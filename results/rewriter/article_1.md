I awakened this morning to the hopeful news that some Russian forces are [pulling back from the Ukrainian border](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60392259) with Ukraine.

paraphrasedout: [like Anne Applebaum](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/lavrov-russia-diplomacy-ukraine/622075/) appear that Russians are always lying, but this isn't the case.

Russia has made perfect sense for the past year if you accept that what Putin is after is actually very straightforward.

Ukraine's own government will not be around for ten years, and its member states are aware of it. 

In exchange, European politicians will have a ready-made excuse to encourage American taxpayers to fund defense spending.

NATO allowed Hungary and Czechoslovakia to fall to Moscow when Joe Biden was young, and the only battles it has ever fought against Serbian and Taliban militants.

paraphrased Russian leaders like Putin don't look at the present and assume it will continue forever. 

 Whether Russian leaders like Vladimir don't look at the present but assume it is.

Americans want to pretend that autocrats like Putin aren't accountable to anyone, but this isn't strictly true.

Ukraine continues to insist that [Crimea and Donbas belong to it](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210823-ukraine-opens-international-summit-calling-for-return-of-crimea-from-russia)could *be in a decade, a scenario where Ukraine joins NATO and then attempts to reclaim these territories, plunging Russia into a conflict it may not be prepared for.*

From Putin's perspective, Ukraine must be neutralized, and the fact that the Zelensky government refuses to suspend NATO membership raises his doubts.

Major Russian forces [who were historically deployed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/15/heres-what-we-know-about-russias-military-buildup-near-ukraine/) in Siberia have been relocated to Siberia's western military districts.

Putin does not want to embark on a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, but if he must, he's willing to go down this road, and he might if his goals cannot be achieved in any other way.

American leaders are obsessed with the idea of [deterrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory), making the fatal mistake in failing to think from Putin's perspective.

When an opponent decides the costs are prohibitive, American deterrence falls short.

paraphrased China has no reason to restrain Putin because Russia and China are [officially strong allies now](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-china-forge-closer-ties-us-preoccupied-struggles-home-rcna15722), like the United States and UK, because America under Biden has refused to make sense and work out a long-term stable agreement to avoid any war over Taiwan or the South China Sea.

Public proclamations of NATO unity [are masking deep divides between the key continental European players, Germany and France, and the United Kingdom/UK.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/world/europe/nato-russia-ukraine-europe.html)

Putin has now successfully bluffed the United States and the United Kingdom into [pulling consultants out of Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/12/pentagon-orders-departure-of-us-troops-in-ukraine.html)if they're caught in the conflict or, y'know, have Ukrainian families who can't just up and leave, meaning airlines are no longer operating.

The suggestion that Russia will attack Ukraine out of nowhere is ridiculous, considering that he gains much more by exhausting Ukraine over time with regular aggressive moves, which Kyiv can't accept than a massive invasion.

Russian intelligence has been aggressively engaged on a maskirovka campaign specifically designed to gaslight American and allied intelligence.

Putin has been able to trap him in a situation where America seems to be screaming chicken little every five minutes.

Putin pulling some troops from the border ahead of the new German chancellor Scholz is a classic tactic.

Russia maintains that Ukraine is planning an attack in Donbas that will hurt Russian civilians.

Over the past year, Russia's military buildup has been slow and deliberate, with sudden movements under the guise of exercises.



American and British media have been [hyping the danger of a false-flag attack](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/us-intelligence-russia-false-flag/index.html). Everyone will do what they want to hear about it.

Both American and Russian sources hinted at the other side launching some sort of chemical weapons attack, which is typical in false-flag operations.

No one will know who did it for some time until one is launched, and many primary facts are still in question despite public doubt.

People from both sides will believe what their leaders and media insist is true, just as Americans are arguing over what happened in the Capitol Attack, so will pundits in America and Russia insist the other side is telling lies.

There are now two basic scenarios for how the Ukraine crisis will end. One is a major bombing that has caused a Russian ultimatum to Zelensky.

Germany convinces Putin [that it will prevent Ukraine from joining NATO by establishing concrete conditions on membership. To be able to meet for twenty years, Germany convinces Putin [that Ukraine will remain Russian plus an effective demilitar zone buffering the two sides along their mutual borders.](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/scholz-flies-moscow-bid-avert-war-2022-02-15/)](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/scholz-flies-moscow-bid-avert-war-2022-02-15/)

Ukraine stands alone, until Putin gets what he wants or Zelensky falls, giving an opening for a coup and the sudden deployment of military forces under the new regime's invitation.

Neutralize the threat of Ukraine joining NATO anytime soon2. 
3. Maintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintaintay over the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbas
4. .

A paltry few American combat troops sent to feign real commitment, it is clear that Putin has already achieved 3 and 4.4.

So now Putin intends to settle 1 and 2, he would obviously prefer to win through negotiations, but it is clear that he is committed to victory, even at a significant price to Russia's international reputation and long-term relationship with Ukraine.

And if an insurgent rebellion does not kill hundreds of Russian soldiers, Ukraine will always be the same people, a big war will sever whatever links remain.

 Eventually Ukraine will be free again.

The Russian military has been averse and reliant on firepower as America's, and because this truth runs up against objective 5, all-out conquest is the most likely result.

A limited operation opens the door to further conquest by non-military means.

The Transatlantic Alliance will always be hindered by [America's continuing demise](https://medium.com/gen/fourth-america-is-almost-over-americans-want-a-divorce-9367a5d50df7), a process that Russia can now actively escalate if it chooses.

Ukraine is running away just like it did in Afghanistan, Biden completely worried about his domestic audience and pitiful hopes for re-election in 2024.

Putin's maskirovka is designed to mask his core objectives, but Putin is savvy enough to know he won't get it if there is an all-out war.

Russia can simply sit back and bombard Ukraine for days or weeks with weapons that Ukraine can't avoid. 

 A direct invasion of Ukraine at any time will follow an initial effort to lyze and crush Ukraine's armed forces in the east.

Russia makes several moves that keep a door open to talks and imply a willingness to back down.

Russia maintains that it is not occupying anyone, just supporting people under attack.

Russia's forces surrounding Ukraine give Putin the opportunity to deploy one at a time or all at once.

Russia has mastered Clausewitz' lesson better than anyone else, but America's plan has failed, and is likely to make everything worse.

The United States leaders are too ignorant of geography, history, and technologies to be trusted in this crisis. Only Europe can deal with Russia.
