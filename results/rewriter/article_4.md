# The end of a democracy

A vastly superior combat force is threatening Ukraine's brothers and sisters.

The world is so ridiculously dependent on Russian energy exports.

Ukraine is so desperate that it wants to [hand out weapons to citizens in the streets](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1496785547594924032).

Most likely, the Russian aim is to surround Kyiv and cause the demise of Ukraine's "Russia" by summer, but once he has absolute control, he'll re-install a proxy power.

> “Western security services believe that Putin intends to overthrow the government and install a puppet regime. This “decapitation” strategy will also take in local governments. Lists have been drawn up of Ukrainian officials to be arrested or killed.”

# Why is Russia attacking Ukraine?

Putin claims that Ukraine is a threat to his mighty nation.

Once Ukraine joins NATO, he'll have a full-scale adversary on his doorstep, but Russia has *constantly invaded Russia **once** since its inception.*

paraphrased The stated aim of Putin's "unique project" is to [demilitarize and de-Nazify the Jewish-led nation](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-military-invade-b2022046.html).

paraphrased Ukraine will remain undefended by NATO so he can keepand the **other two countries** **[**[for two decades**.**](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1569684/Russia-Ukraine-Vladimir-Putin-separatist-states-evg)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea)**

A *lot of Russian energy products are being shipped to market by Ukraine pipelines.*

Russia has no reservations about [starving millions of Ukrainians to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) to feed its people.

Putin wants Russia to own [everything it has ever owned in history.](https://snyder.substack.com/p/how-to-think-about-war-in-ukraine)

# Art imitates life

This whole story began when [a Jewish TV comedian played a teacher who was elected President after going on a rant about corruption.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9smD823aE0)

President Zelenskyy captured Ukrainian citizens' hearts and minds because he *cast a vision of a fairer world*.

# The poor always lose

The West will respond with economic sanctions aimed at [cripple the Russian economy](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/boris-johnson-vows-cripple-dictator-121327747.html).

A hard crash or long-term depression will bring untold suffering to our Russian brothers and sisters, who are also suffering and suffering for the poor and working-class in the West.

Russia is simply following America's playbook. *All* war is morally wrong, no matter who perpetrates it. But let's not pretend the West is innocent right now.

# What we can do about the situation in Ukraine

Russia invaded Ukraine to solidify its hold on two eastern regions.

paraphrased Pray and/or meditate on what actions we are going to take with our families2. 
[Stop buying Russian products (vodka obviously), but more importantly, pay the extra to switch from oil/solar/geothermal/etc.)-](https://survivingtomorrow.org/here-are-35-ways-you-can-help-ukraine-right-now-8c90a0c2bd93)

My friends, the war will not fix this planet or change corrupt hearts.
