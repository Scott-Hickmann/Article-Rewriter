My grandmothers, both in their mid- to late 80s, escaped Ukraine this weekend, a feat we did not expect to achieve, not only because of their age but also because of the rapidly deteriorating conflict.

Keep the faith. On her arrival to Bulgaria, my grandmother, a WWII survivor and now the War in Ukraine, told me, 

 Keeping the faith.
