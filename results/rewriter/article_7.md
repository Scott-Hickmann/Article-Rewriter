A review of the channel's posts shows that War on Fakes is not objective, rather pushing content to promote narratives echoed by Russian state media and the Kremlin.

The channel has started to be noticed by mainstream Russian propaganda agencies.

The assertion that the photo was staged has been [debunked](https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/ca6d93d1), as metadata revealed that the photograph was in fact taken on the day of the Chuhiv airstrike.

Hundreds of other controversial allegations have been dismissed, including that the corpses seen in photographs of a Kyiv TV tower's attack may have been taken in from a nearby morgue.

The channel has gained significant traction in Russia and is expected to be amplified by prominent Russian outlets, and

War on Fakes is now attempting to expand into multiple region-specific channels and translations of its website into French, Spanish, and Chinese.
