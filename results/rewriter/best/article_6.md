Today, my friend in Kyiv, a mother who had just been separated from her children when they were evacuated out of the city, was evacuated out of the area.

> ‘second time in 3 months I had to hand over my baby girl, not knowing if I will ever see her again. This is a pain only a mother can know. It’s more painful than all of war put together. The hatred in me grows every day.’

Putin is cursing Russians with the same burden.

My grandfather was released Belsen concentration camp[, but I didn't really know his father until he was seven years old.](https://medium.com/lessons-from-history/75-years-ago-my-grandfather-arrived-at-belsen-concentration-camp-8a34eedac2af)

Ukraine has been open to the world ever since it sacked out his last puppet king (as may be, the case with Chechnya and Syria)

Russia, as a brand, is now so poisonous that no company can afford any association with it.

Putin has quickly made Russia hated around the world.

Germany was openly feared and mocked. What we now consider racist jokes about Germans was utterly hated.



Germany is a young nation with new generations of people, and both have led by example when it comes to owning and building positively on their history.

A few years ago, I was out one night in Berlin to ask if he was okay. He was a little inebriated, and the full weight of history press down on him.

We sat down for some time, but I knew he'd spend the coming years learning how to disentangle himself from his country's past.

Germany, which has witnessed such a strong German struggle throughout history, is trying to figure out what being German means in the last century's shadow, unfair, and a betrayal of them by previous generations.

I felt myself gazing at them while others were watching them.

I will never forget or forgive it if the Russian army kills my friends.

Our children will grow up with tales of this war, with the raw sadness and rage we are feeling. We'll find it difficult not to hold them accountable when they first started to kill people we know — their country, their leader, and their army.

Putin has re-written Russian history from a failed dictatorship to an enrage that has brought death and disgrace to Europe.

And the most brainwashed Russians will know the truth about Putin as time goes.

Russia will have to disentangle themselves from these crimes as young Germans have had to do, but the West will now shift away from tolerating both Russian aggression and Russian money.

And if someone like Navalny manages to come to power and rebuild the country into some sort of vaguely functioning democracy, Ukraine will never forgive Russia.

Hitler set out to create a greater Germany but ended up destroying virtually every other place, including Germany, by the time he is finished, he will have scarred generations of hatred, pain, and grief into the Ukrainian people's collective memory.
