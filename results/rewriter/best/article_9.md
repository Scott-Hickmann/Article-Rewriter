People don't like to discuss how the very concept of "NFT value" is so complicated.

I am an educator, and I attest that anyone who is more familiar with NFTs was expected to answer these questions for themselves at some point in their journey from JPEG to DAO.

NFTs have soared in popularity, but most likely will not remain popular for very long. 

Of course, this isn't as alarming as it seems.

People can buy, sell, and profit from their NFTs, the essence of an NFT collection is actually the community organized by virtue of shared ownership of virtual assets.

If someone tells you they've got NFTs all figured out, consider twice before inviting them to your Web3 dinner party.
