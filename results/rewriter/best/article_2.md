When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States emerged with an unquestioned military and political hegemony over the entire globe.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has ignited a touchpaper that would show that world wars in the nuclear age were all cold wars.

# Democracy vs. Authoritarianism

State control is still abound, but rigorous central economic planning and collection does not.

Second, some may argue that the First Cold War was still a contest between democracy and authoritarianism, which does not have a historical basis.

Now as the Second Cold War begins, it is clear that left right political ideologies are increasingly meaningless for understanding what's going on, but that their desire to define authoritarian regimes as morally acceptable and politically superior.

The other side of the discussion hereafter referred to as the Democracy Bloc based in the United States and its NATO allies as a similarly diverse ideological group.

# Hot Spots

This new cold war can be said to be in full swing as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but conflict areas have spanned the globe and have been active for some time now, including Taiwan's continued independence.

Taiwan has attempted to establish its nexus over the contested South China Sea by building islands and military installations and threatening those that pass through.

The number of hot or hard power conflicts extends beyond the military domain to economics and clandestine operations, as they did during the First Cold War.

# Competing to Lead

The Democracy Bloc is determined to show that liberal democracy survived in the First Cold War for a reason, although authoritarians insist that only those at the top are supported by the new system.

China has been expanding its foreign investment, mainly via [its Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative), into the developing world.

China has just seen a glimpse of these aspirations through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

The summit brought together over 100 countries, not including China or Russia, to discuss the democratic model's superiority and ways in which democracies can develop themselves.

# Conclusion

As Russian tanks roll through Ukraine and China's global leadership, there can be no doubt that a new global cold war has emerged.
