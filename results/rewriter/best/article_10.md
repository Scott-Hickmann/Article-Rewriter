How big a basketball and LeBron James fan I am. For those that don't know me, you will quickly learn about my obsession for the sport.

Basketball, to me, is an educational tool. One could say that I'm a nerd when it comes to hoops.

**Basketball.**

The Golden State Warriors visited the Los Angeles Lakers for a prime-time game on national television last night.

Bettors were favored in this matchup in LA, with Golden State being the heavy favorite for bettors.

The Lakers got off the game hot before falling down double-digits midway through the game; exactly what fans expected based on how the season had gone.

The next nine minutes of basketball were straight out of a movie.

Both teams went back and forth for the entire quarter as both teams desperately needed a victory.

LeBron James, who has worked with multiple franchises over his 19-year career, had just done it again.

This victory changed the tone of this season's season's game completely.

The city discovered the glimmer of hope for this season after a family member of mine who doesn't follow basketball too closely.

This team still has a few issues to address, but if you asked most Lakers fans before last night,

 if you asked them.

paraphrasedout: You've always had a chance as long as LeBron is on your team.
