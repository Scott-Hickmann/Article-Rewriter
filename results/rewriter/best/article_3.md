Nikita Khrushchev, Russia's First Party Secretary, delivered a speech called [On The Cult Of Personality And Its Consequences *in 1956, three years after Stalin's death.*](https://www.ht.lu.se/media/utbildning/dokument/kurser/EUHA14/20121/Nikita_S._Khrushchev__The_Secret_Speech_On_the_Cult_of_Personality_1956.pdf)

> The negative characteristics of Stalin, which, in Lenin’s time, were only incipient, transformed themselves during the last years into a grave abuse of power by Stalin, which caused untold harm to our party.Stalin acted not through persuasion, explanation, and patient cooperation with people, but by imposing his concepts and demanding absolute submission to his opinion. […]You see to what Stalin’s mania for greatness led? He had completely lost consciousness of reality.

All that was left was reality after Stalin's "cult of personality" had been revealed as a lie.

[drug addicts and Neo-Nazis](https://youtu.be/dTw3hWa3E8M) are attempting to portray Russia as [liberators rather than occupiers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/pure-orwell-how-russian-state-media-spins-ukraine-invasion-as-liberation).

Putin attempted to explain the impending economic sanctions to an assembly of oligarchs who stood out:

> Everything that is happening is a desperate measure. They left us no other option. They’ve created such security risks that we couldn’t react differently. […] They could have created such risks that no one knows how the country was to exist.

Understanding independence in Ukraine may pose a threat to Russia's stability at a time of such high risk.

It's no coincidence that Trump, the president of "[alternative facts](https://youtu.be/VSrEEDQgFc8)" and "fake news," described Putin's manufactured justifications for the Ukraine invasion as "[genius](https://youtu.be/cRpeJpBYXVs)" and "wonderful."

Ukraine's embrace of democracy and recent attempts to join the European Union represented a nation right on Russia's doorstep, whose thoughts Putin couldn't comprehend.

And if it wasn't being used to the same devastating effect, the playbook they used is still alive and well today.

Modern-day tyrants still rule the land.

When their ego is jeopardized, there's the inevitable sabre-rattling.

A leader who is based on lies seems as if he is losing sight of the story.
