This morning, I awakened the promising news that some Russian forces are  [pulling back from the border with Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60392259) . Sadly, this isn't quite the positive sign it should be. MD0) Anyone who is familiar with Russian military history and doctrine knows that Moscow is relying on *maskirovka*maskirovka *.* Like Anne Applebaum[, Russianphobic bigots](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/lavrov-russia-diplomacy-ukraine/622075/)  believe that Russians are always lying, but that is not the case. Maskirovka is about keeping an opponent guessing about your true intentions, and nothing more — everything else is just fluff designed to muddy waters. Putin, an old KGB hand, knows this game and plays it well. Everything Russia has achieved in the last year makes perfect sense if you accept that what Putin is after is actually very straightforward. He wants Ukraine to become a Russian client state as Belarus is today. This means that Ukraine will no longer be a member of NATO. Any smart observer knows  [Ukraine isn't joining NATO any time soon](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/us/politics/nato-ukraine.html) MD0) Ukraine is too corrupt and undemocratic to be eligible for membership now, and NATO will not be around in ten years, and its member states know it. NATO is a tool that can help American taxpayers finance defense spending. 

 The United States should not be able to fund defense spending. In exchange, European politicians get a ready-made excuse to allow America to do their dirty jobs while still behaving in public as if they're restraining America's worst impulses. NATO  [absolutely failed in Afghanistan for a reason](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/czech-president-natos-failure-afghanistan-puts-its-legitimacy-question-2021-08-17/) : NATO has always been a bluff, with [mutual mortal adversaries Greece and Turkey](https://www.brookings.edu/research/turkey-europe-and-the-eastern-mediterranean-charting-a-way-out-of-the-current-deadlock/)  attempting to discourage the Soviet Union from attacking countries vital to American interests. NATO allowed Hungary and Czechoslovakia to fall to Moscow when Joe Biden was young, and the only wars it has ever fought against Serbian and Taliban militants. But Russian Presidents like Putin don't look at the present and assume it will continue for ever. They plan to plan ten years down the road, utilizing their recent knowledge of being basically at the mercy of America and NATO in the 1990s and 2000s. As if America itself is a victim, Americans blindly joined the fake war to protect democracy, but this isn't strictly true. MD0) The Russian people could protest against their draconian government, but few will protest so long as the economy is stable and Russia feels important on the international stage, as well as the United States' president, who is also responsible for all world powers. Putin remains in office by promising that he will always be the case. So he has a right to look into the future and estimate where Russia  *will be in a decade.* MD0)Because Ukraine continues to insist [Crimea and Donbas are part of it](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210823-ukraine-opens-international-summit-calling-for-return-of-crimea-from-russia)  (and in a foreign legal sense, this is of course true), a future nightmare scenario haunts Moscow's hopes, as Ukraine joins NATO and plunges Russia into a conflict it is unprepared for. MD0): Ukraine must be neutralized from Putin's perspective, and the fact that the Zelensky government refuses to suspend NATO membership raises his doubts. Putin is clearly determined to end the tumultuous situation along the Russian-Ukraine border one way or another, and although he may be bluffing about the possibility of it happening in Kyiv, the danger of it happening can't be ignored. Major Russian military forces  [in Siberia have been sent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/15/heres-what-we-know-about-russias-military-buildup-near-ukraine/)  in Siberia, where they have been posted in Siberia  [for the western military districts.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/15/heres-what-we-know-about-russias-military-buildup-near-ukraine/) It's no accident that they are arranged in a way that makes it impossible to tell if an attack is about to begin. Putin does not want to launch a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. MD0) But he is giving every plausible indication that he's willing to go down this road if he wants to, and he might if his goals cannot be achieved in any other way. The United States' leaders are fixated on the theory of [deterrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory), making the fatal mistake in failing to consider Putin's perspective. deterrence is derived from  [cost-benefit analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis) , a process that I became familiar with when obtaining two of policy-focused masters degrees in grad school. Americans are 100% *lurve* cost-benefit analysis because it seems more concrete than it really is. MD0) What gets counted as a cost or benefit is usually a matter of opinion, and those with wealth often have the ability to control the way they like more often than not. The CBA is used in policy mostly to justify an action that some politician wants to take and needs to cover for, but it does not include critical soft factors such as future aspirations. When an opponent decides that the costs are not justified, American deterrence falls short, as they usually are. This is why America's sanctions obsession is so vain and toothless — by the time they're used, the perpetrator has already found a way around them. Sanctions are a way of proving tough to a domestic audience and little more. MD0): In Putin's case, the threat of being cut off from the global banking system or natural gas exports to Europe is easily mitigated with Chinese help — Russia and China are now  [strong allies, as well as the United States and the United Kingdom.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-china-forge-closer-ties-us-preoccupied-struggles-home-rcna15722) Because America under Biden has refused to make sense and work out a long-term stable agreement to avoid any conflict over Taiwan or the South China Sea, China has no reason to punish Putin. MD0) The world has seen NATO scramble and take ineffective steps to shield itself, leaving Ukraine virtually alone, with weapons only useful in a bitter, [mutually destructive rebellion](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/us/politics/russia-ukraine-biden-military.html) . Public proclamations of NATO unity  [are masking deep divides between the key continental European players, Germany and France, and the United Kingdom/UK.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/world/europe/nato-russia-ukraine-europe.html) Putin has now successfully bluffed the United States and the United Kingdom into [pulling consultants out of Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/12/pentagon-orders-departure-of-us-troops-in-ukraine.html)  and  [evacuations are now out of Ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/11/1080060546/biden-us-citizens-leave-ukraine) , while  [has no assistance](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/11/1080060546/biden-us-citizens-leave-ukraine)  if they are trapped in the conflict or, y'know, have Ukrainian families who can't just up and leave 

. The threat of war means airlines are no longer operating, so airlines are no longer available. Investment in Ukraine is going to be a big risk going forward. America's leadership is assisting Putin in his victory over Putin. The irony is that *so far* all Putin has done is load his rifle and do some target practice around Ukraine. Putin does not have to decide on a date to attack Ukraine; rather, he can simply park his troops where they are located as a persistent, existential threat. The suggestion that Russia will attack Ukraine out of nowhere is ridiculous, because he makes more money by exhausting Ukraine over time with regular aggressive moves, which Kyiv can't accept than a massive invasion. 0: For the past month, Russian intelligence has been aggressively engaged on a maskirovka campaign specifically designed to gaslight American and allied intelligence. Politicians and pundits are latching on every intelligence intercept  [alleging nefarious Russian activities](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/02/does-biden-still-think-a-russian-invasion-is-inevitable.html) , ranging from false-flag attacks to coup plots against Zelensky. MD0) What's funny about watching the Biden Administration pretend that it will deter Russian actions by pointing out everything they're talking about is that it gives Russia a concrete means of faking America out. Now knowing that Biden will publicly announce every bizarre plan that someone discusses in Moscow, Putin has been able to trap him in a dynamic where America seems to be screaming chickens every five minutes. From Putin's perspective, Biden, with every warning not backed by a threat of meaningful action, weakens America's position. If any diplomatic agreement prevents the outbreak of war, it would result from German efforts underway this week. PUTIN pulling troops from the border ahead of the new German chancellor Scholz is a classic tactic. It *Looks* like he's keeping a diplomatic off ramp, which he is, but not for the reasons American politicians prefer. 0:01) From Putin's remark about  *why*  Russia is concerned about Ukraine has ushered a dramatic conclusion: Russia has said that Ukraine is planning an attack in Donbas, and that it will hurt Russian civilians, as shown by the day's Crimea. Yesterday, the Russian Duma ordered Putin to honor Donetsk and Lukhansk, which in turn means Russia will annex them under the pretense of shielding Russian civilians. 0) Russia's military buildup has been slow and deliberate over the past year, with sudden movements under the guise of exercises. MD0) This is a long-term change in Russia's positions, which is meant to announce that Russia has a long-term relationship with China, and that future conflicts in Europe and Asia will always be linked. I seriously doubt any conflict in Ukraine begins with a sudden Russian attack — the bluff that might have triggered London and Washington's alarm but not to Putin's domestic rhetoric. What he needs to defend an attack is an outburst of brutality that seems to be on the rise in Donbas. That's why American and British media have been [hyping the danger of a false-flag attack](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/us-intelligence-russia-false-flag/index.html) . The issue with them doing this is that false-flag operations are impossible to quantify with any certainty — if an attack occurs, everyone will do what they want to hear about it. My concern is that Wagner-affiliated mercenaries are planning a big attack in Donbas that will take place before the end of February. MD0:Both American and  [Russian sources](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-us-mercenaries-plan-chemical-attack-ukraine/)  weeks ago speculated at the other side's launching of some sort of chemical weapons attack, which is typical in false-flag operations. When one is announced, no one will know who did it for some time. It took months of direct inspections to establish [Syria used chemical weapons in Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_chemical_weapons_in_the_Syrian_civil_war) , but many of the main facts are also questioned by public doubt. People on both directions and media will believe what their leaders and media insist is true — the old saying about the first casualty of war being the truth sticks around for a reason. Just as Americans are fighting over what happened in the Capitol Attack, pundits in America and Russia are arguing that the other side is lying. There are now two common scenarios for how the Ukraine crisis will end. One of the major blows that triggered a Russian ultimatum to Zelensky is a big blow. This will force Ukraine to choose either unfair talks that result in the cession of Donbas and Crimea permanently, or a large war that Ukraine cannot win without significant military assistance. My hope is that [Germany convinces Putin](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/scholz-flies-moscow-bid-avert-war-2022-02-15/) that it will prevent Ukraine from joining NATO by establishing concrete conditions on membership. 

 Kyiv is unlikely to be able to meet for twenty years. Autonomy for Donbas and an understanding that Crimea will remain Russian plus an effective demilitarized zone buffering the two sides along their mutual boundaries is also likely to be crucial to prevent a war. MD0) The conflict must be settled for a decade, and I suspect it will be this year, one way or another. MD0: Now that Ukraine is alone, Putin can keep ratcheting up the pressure on Kyiv until he gets what he wants or Zelensky falls, opening the way for a coup and the sudden deployment of military forces under the new regime's invitation. Putin's priorities in this crisis are ranked according to importance: 1. 

 1.  0 Neutralize the threat of Ukraine joining NATO anytime soon. Maintain has the majority of the Russian-speaking Donbas3 in charge. Weaken NATO over the long run by demonstrating its inability. Demonstrate America's inability to do anything to protect allies. MD0)Pull Ukraine has been integrated into Russia's orbit permanently For all NATO's bluster over being more united than ever and a select few American combat troops deployed to feign real commitment, it is clear that Putin has already achieved 3 and 4. MD0) In the face of direct military threats to a partner that could hurt American civilians, Biden is backing down as quickly as he can, while trying to refocus America's attention on China. So now Putin intends to address 1 and 2. MD0) He would obviously prefer to win through negotiations, but it is clear that even at a significant price to Russia's international reputation and long-term relationship with Ukraine, he is committed to victory. The key deterrent to a big invasion is the fact that, despite his assertion that Russians and Ukrainians will always be the same people, a big war will permanently break whatever bonds remain. Even if an insurgent Russian soldier is killed hundreds of Russian troops, eventually Ukraine will be free again. Because this truth runs up against objective 5, the least likely result is a all-out conquest. Putin is more cautious than people praise, and Russia's newly-professional military is as casualty averse and reliant on firepower as America's, but it is unlikely that an invasion would be the catalyst to bring this about except in the last resort. A major military setback in Ukraine's east would, however, be both NATO's inability to help and Zelensky's inability to shield his civilians. A limited operation opens the door to further conquest by non-military means. Despite the fact that troop deployments were disregarded, Putin does not want to conquer Ukraine by force. MD0) Having to do this would be a partial failure of his own plan and could result in a united European Union response, which would be worse for Russia than a united NATO. The Transatlantic Alliance will always be hindered by [America's defunct](https://medium.com/gen/fourth-america-is-almost-over-americans-want-a-divorce-9367a5d50df7) , a process that Russia will now actively expand if it chooses — and may, as part of Putin's ultimate revenge for the Soviet Union's demise. Were I in his position, so that would be my ultimate aim. But for Putin, objectives 1 and 2 are vital. Everything he has done to bring NATO and America in a tizzy is supposed to do one thing: you are alone. And Ukraine is Ukraine. 

 And here is how it is. America is running away, just as it did in Afghanistan, Biden is entirely worried about his domestic audience and pitiful hopes for re-election in 2024. MD0) Biden, a classic politician who looks solely for his own interests, cannot be trusted, and he is as much a catalyst of America's demise as Trump. Putin's maskirovka is intended to mask his primary objectives. Objective 5 is on his way to becoming a hero in the event of an all-out war, but Putin is smart enough to know that if there is an all-out war. MD0)Instead, after a sufficient provocation now or this summer, Russia will sit back and bombard Ukraine for days or weeks with weapons that Ukraine can't cope with. A direct invasion of Ukraine at any time would follow an initial attempt to destabilize and crush Ukraine's armed forces in the east because the key objective in all war is to defeat your enemy's military, not capture their cities. So if war breaks out soon, the likely course of events will be similar to this: * Russia makes several moves that keep a door open to talks and imply a willingness to back down
* 
If Zelensky resists, rebels in Donbas begin to march, with a threat of total destruction if he does not comply with Russian artillery and air. * 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* PUTIN  Putin denies that an invasion is underway, even as Ukraine's forces are smashed from the air. If sanctions are lifted, he will increase the threat to Ukraine's military infrastructures. If Ukraine talks, the attacks will cease. MD0) At this point, it's on America to face the sanctions threat, but Russia insists it is not attacking anyone, just supporting people under attack. The big attack that I fear could involve chemical weapons in order to specifically question American claims of Russian involvement and warn the world of the lies that brought America into Iraq. If major combat starts, it will continue until Zelensky comes to terms or falls to a coup after Ukraine's military forces are wiped out. 0: Russia's forces surrounding Ukraine's Crimes threaten Putin, who may choose one or all at once. Maskirovka, as well as all Russian military doctrine, is based on Soviet experiences in the Second World War. Russia does not see war as the definition-obsessed Americans do — it isn't something announced, waged, and then ended. War is politics, and politics is war, and Russia has learned Clausewitz' lessons better than anyone else. All combat takes place on a continuum, and each move made is part of a larger, multi-layered game. Violence is simply a device that can be used to make a case. I hope, hope, and pray that a war can still be avoided. But America's plan has failed, and it is likely that it is making it worse. In the long run, only Europe will ever protect Ukraine. Only Europe can cope with Russia. The American leaders are too ignorant of geography, history, and technologies to be trusted in this crisis.
