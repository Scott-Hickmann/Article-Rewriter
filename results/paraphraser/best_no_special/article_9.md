People don't like to discuss how the very concept of 'NFT value' is so complicated — one of the most complicated concepts I've ever investigated! As a result, people are coerced into inaccurate representations by the media, who openly condemn these depictions. 0) 0 

 These questions are dismissed as "dumb" by the time people trying to learn about NFTs. As an educator, I can assure you that these questions are not dumb. In fact, they're absolutely vital — anyone who reads NFTs more closely is expected to answer these questions for themselves at some point in their journey from JPEG to DAO. The following ten questions are distilled from countless conversations I've had with people about NFTs. The answer to every question is a significant step toward understanding the NFT's value. 0.

 0 How is an NFT different from a JPEG?  How can an NFT differ from a JPEG?  What is the difference between an NFT and just "right-click saving" an image online? NFTs are pieces of the internet that can actually be owned. They are permanently in a virtual record book that can never be updated, only added-onto. With a verified owner, NFTs will behave like collectibles like baseball cards. **2. 

 0  0 Who cares who owns the photograph if anyone wants to see it?  Just like anyone else can see a work of art in a gallery, only the owner has the right to sell it or commercialize it. ***3. 

. . So can I make my own NFTs and sell them?  Yes, everyone can make their own NFTs, but they may not be cheap to sell. For example, if you made your own baseball cards, would they be as useful to others as ones made by Major League Baseball? Or, if you're in the art world — If people don't know you as an artist, will they be able to pay for your work? 4.

 4.0 Why do certain NFTs sell for so much more than they do?  Why does it cost so much?  The most valuable NFTs are part of a reputable collection. These collections have a limited number of NFTs in them, and some collections have become extremely popular and desirable, often for different reasons. MD0) For example, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) brand is now a well-known brand that celebrities and businesses now buy into every week. In comparison, the CryptoPunks collection is considered the first NFT collection to be ever created. Owning a Punk is like owning a piece of technological history. As a collection rises in value, each constituent NFT receives more. It's important to note that it's easy to determine whether your NFT is part of a recognized collection or not. While you can make an NFT that looks just like an NFT from a valuable collection of thousands of dollars, anyone online will quickly see that it is not an authentic piece from the original collection. 5.

 5.0 Is that all?  Is that true?  NFTs are not the same thing as cryptocurrencies, speculation, profits, or scams. In fact, whether you like it or not, the essence of an NFT collection is actually "community." The idea of a community of owners is built-in to every NFT collection's very concept. The most obvious example of this is the proliferation of private online chat rooms that are only accessible to people who can prove that they own a piece of a particular NFT collection. This aspect of value is extremely difficult to convey to those who have never been a member of an NFT group. 0 

 Despite reflection, all I can say is that NFTs are uncannily effective at uniting communities of like-minded individuals both online and in-person — I suggest entering one such community yourself! 6.

 6 So are NFTs just a way to buy friends?  NFTs are not like memberships to a country club or social club, but they can be so much more expensive. NFTs have branched out from the artwork attached to them (which, I admit, is often disappointing) to a variety of different uses or "utilities." Any NFTs enable you to participate in a real-world asset, such as a company. 0

 : The owners of your NFTs can now help your favorite musicians and then share their earnings with them. NFTs are redefining ownership of both virtual and physical assets, as shown by the author. 7. 

 7  7 Why do you need NFTs to join a club or invest in a company? 

 Why do you need NFTs to join a club or invest in a company?  NFTs are revolutionary in the sense that they make membership or ownership of individuals easily accessible, sellable, and transferable among individuals through online marketplaces for NFTs. Obtaining your digital wallet is a simple task. NFTs can even be organized into Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), which are similar to mini-corporations with no central leadership that can make decisions based on automatic voting systems that can be controlled bottom-up by NFT holders. Isn't that wild?  Isn't that strange? 8.8. 

 8. Are NFTs a fad?  Are they a fad? 

 Are they a fad?  While perfumes have risen in popularity recently, but they do not tend to be around for very long. NFTs have certainly the same characteristics as fads! For example, NFT values are rather subjective, and NFTs have soared in importance in the last year. Despite the fact that NFTs' value is largely determined by the community, this isn't as alarming as it seems. 0) Although it's likely that people value intangible assets like NFTs first, let's back up a bit and discuss value in general. Why do people value Teslas or Rolexes or even the Saint Laurent leather jacket? MD0) What is abstract art?  What is abstract art? 

 What is abstract art? At one time in history, I can say that many people doubted the value of items connected to such intangible value. They don't anymore. I argue that NFTs are simply an extension of what some people consider to be valuable. 9.

  9. So NFTs are here to stay?  We've come a long way from JPEGs, so we've come a long way from JPEGs. Hopefully, I've told you that although people buy, sell, and profit from their NFTs, the core of an NFT collection is actually the community organized by virtue of shared ownership of virtual assets. 0) Because of the ability of NFTs to organize such groups, I do believe that NFTs will remain here to stay. 10. 

 10.  10.1. What is the next step? 

 What is the next step?  People are looking for new ways to use NFTs every day. MD0) Like I said before, NFTs are redefining ownership in new and unexpected ways. NFT owners have recently attempted to buy entire sports teams (or even the Constitution of the United States! The NFT is used by the officers for political control. Some people are using NFTs for the next wave of "play to earn" video games, including NFTs. I am still being amazed by the promise of what an NFT can be like. In fact, I've been convinced that the word "NFT" is now vastly outdated — "NFTs" are no longer a single term but rather a heterogeneous group of utilities. We've only scratched the surface of how to use this amazing technology. And the people I know working on it are nothing short of extraordinary. When someone tells you they've got NFTs all figured out, consider twice before inviting them to your Web3 dinner party;)
