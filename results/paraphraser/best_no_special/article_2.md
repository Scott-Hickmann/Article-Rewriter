"In summary, we have here [in the Soviet Union] a political force committed fanatically to the belief that there is no permanent *modus vivendi*, that our internal balance is essential and necessary, and that if Soviet power is to be secure," American diplomat George Kennan wrote these words in "The Long Telegram" [as he set out.  "In summary, we have here [in the Soviet Union] that there isomo"*"*"(MD](https://www.cfr.org/blog/history-cold-war-40-quotes) What followed was a war of more than 40 years between the two world's most influential powers. The two empires were unable to confront each other directly, despite ever expanding nuclear arsenals. Instead, their ideological rivalry devolved into clandestine strikes, economic power grabs, and open warfare that engulfed every corner of the globe. The United States emerged with an unquestioned military and political hegemony over the entire globe when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. The American ideological system had gone the distance where the USSR's had failed. Now a new war of a similar vein has started, and perhaps future history books will show that world wars in the nuclear age were all cold wars. However, the Second Cold War has started. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has ignited long-running tensions and divisions, much like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Nazi invasion of Poland. Though Russia is now a rival of the US and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) led bloc, this time around, they are still the [junior partner](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/07/25/how-vladimir-putins-embrace-of-china-weakens-russia) of the influential and ascendant People's Republic of China's This cold war has yet another defining feature, its ideological division. A political divide between democratic and authoritarian regimes exists in place of the duel between capitalist and communist economic structures. This Second Cold War will either be the grave of liberal democracy or the biggest triumph since World War II. Overly simplistic reports will show that this new cold war can be conceptualized within a similar framework to the old one for two reasons. First, it will be suggested that China is now another communist power battling the capitalist world. This is inaccurate, pure economic communism anywhere in the world is long dead. Since the 1970s, the Chinese government has shifted away from traditional communism and toward a new model of [authoritarian capitalism](https://theconversation.com/how-china-combined-authoritarianism-with-capitalism-to-create-a-new-communism-167586), for the lack of a better term. State control is still abounding, but rigorous central economic planning and collection does not. Competition and creativity are strongly encouraged within the state's boundaries. Meanwhile, socialist theories and policies have achieved varying degrees of acceptability and implementation around the democratic world. Second, some may have argued that the First Cold War was still a contest between democracy and authoritarianism. This argument simply does not stand up to historical scrutiny. While both of the main combatants, particularly the United States, appeared to be fighting democracy's cause, it was never more than a secondary issue, if that. The developing world was rife with failed and or authoritarian regimes that were propped up or sponsored by the US because of those regimes' commitment to anti-communism. However, although authoritarianism closely followed Soviet Communism, the USSR was always committed to the expansion of the communist system and had little sympathy for authoritarian states that remained outside of their ideological boundaries. Now as the Second Cold War begins, it is clear that left right political ideologies are increasingly meaningless for understanding what's going on. China and Russia are ideologically distinct, and can be characterized as distant on the political spectrum. However, their desire to define authoritarian regimes as morally acceptable and politically superior is what unites them. This Chinese-Russian-centered Authoritarian Bloc is ranked among the most diverse bloc of states that includes Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela. The other hand, which is referred to as the Democracy Bloc based on the United States and its NATO allies, represents a similarly diverse ideological group. This plurality is even greater when considering the additional Democracy Bloc states of the European Union, Latin American allies like Mexico, and Asian allies like India, Japan, and South Korea. The Democracy Bloc does also have some odd allies, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, who have broken the bloc's values. These countries are likely to be caught in the middle as the new cold war progresses. Ultimately, ideology matters for little. What matters in this new cold war is the organizing political principle of a country's government, whether it be democratic or based on limits on control and free and fair elections or authoritarian with arbitrary executive power. This new cold war can be said to be in full swing as a result of Russia's takeover of Ukraine, but the areas of conflict are also global and have been active for some time now. Perhaps the next hottest location can be said to be [Taiwan](https://www.economist.com/china/2021/10/09/china-is-ratcheting-up-military-pressure-on-taiwan). For some time now, the Chinese military has been planning for a future invasion of Taiwan even as the US and its allies have [strategized](https://www.ft.com/content/54b0db59-a403-493e-b715-7b63c9c39093) for its defense. China has many strategic and economic reasons for the conquest of Taiwan, but perhaps the most important motivation is symbolic. Taiwan is the last holdover of a non-communist China and has always enjoyed the United States' vague support. Taiwan's resurgent independence in a territory that China claims to be its own. The conquest of Taiwan will reveal that China is an equal of the United States that cannot be cowed or threatened. For the United States, it would be the death knell of long-fading American global dominance. Taiwan is therefore vital to the current cold war because it could result in direct conflict between the main combatants. Taiwan is part of a Second Cold War showdown that is mirrored in events in [Hong Kong](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/03/20/china-is-not-just-shackling-hong-kong-it-is-remaking-it) and the South China Sea. Since the United Kingdom returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, the city had served as an oasis of democracy and civil liberties in a desert of authoritarianism. Starting in 2019, Beijing introduced stringent limits on the city and brutally repressed democracy campaigners in response to western leaders' meaningless verbal objections. To [intimidate](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/15/hong-kong-protestors-burn-lebron-james-jerseys-nba) and silence western critics of its repression, China also used gatekeeping of access to its vast internal market. Meanwhile, China has attempted to reclaim control of the contested South China Sea by building islands and military installations and threatening those that pass through. This has had direct repercussions for several countries in the region, including Taiwan. The United States has continued to be present in the sea and challenge Chinese claims. Most recent [members](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Indo-Pacific/Europe-pushes-back-against-Beijing-with-shows-of-Indo-Pacific-muscle) of the Democracy Bloc have been deployed in combating the South China Sea. In a [treaty](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/09/25/aukus-reshapes-the-strategic-landscape-of-the-indo-pacific) with Australia and the United Kingdom, the US agreed to share its nuclear submarine technology for the second time recently. This is a step to extend the Democracy Bloc's hand against China, and has sparked many Chinese rebukes and protests. The range of hot or hard power conflicts extends beyond the military to economics and clandestine activities, as they did during the First Cold War. The United States launched a possibly overdue trade war [with China in 2018 in response to the numerous Chinese abuses of the economic relationship between the two countries.](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/01/01/new-research-counts-the-costs-of-the-sino-american-trade-war) As the competition heats, US companies have begun a slow shift away from China. Both [China](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/02/19/china-wants-to-insulate-itself-against-western-sanctions) and [Russia](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/04/23/the-kremlin-has-isolated-russias-economy) have also begun concerted efforts to develop "fortress economies" or economic structures that are significantly less dependent on the west and therefore less vulnerable to sanctions and economic pressure by the global economic system that has been crafted in large part by US leadership. It's likely that globalization will be reversed in the near future as economic ties match more closely the current political divisions of the Second Cold War. [China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/theres-chinese-interference-on-both-sides-of-the-2020-election/2020/10/29/49f90dfe-1a2c-11eb-82db-60b15c874105_story.html) and to a much greater extent [Russia](https://www.csis.org/blogs/technology-policy-blog/russia-ramps-global-elections-interference-lessons-united-states) have coordinated efforts of misinformation campaigns and election interference with the apparent intention of destabilizing democratic countries. Though the most notable case was the support of the Trump campaign by Russian actions in 2016, the authoritarian Bloc's election interference has swept the globe, affecting Europe, Latin America, and Asia. It's less about picking winners and more about inducing instability and sowing divisions among democratic countries' populations. So much the better for the Authoritarian Bloc if leading democratic countries can be examples of the unreliability of democratic institutions. However, the most significant and alarming conflict of the new cold war is the unfolding [Russian invasion](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/24/russia-invades-ukraine) of Ukraine, the country's biggest European war since World War II. The rash Russian action brought what had been a developing global contest out into the open. Vladimir Putin seems to have believed his own story, which was beset by division and inefficiency, would fall by the wayside as the day of authoritarianism dawned. In reality, he has shown that the Democracy Bloc, at least for the time, will be up to the task. NATO allies of the left, right, and center in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany have worked together to admonish Russia and back Ukraine, then to punish Russian aggression first. President Putin has made his country an [unequil enemy](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/02/19/whether-he-invades-ukraine-or-backs-down-putin-has-harmed-russia?itm_source=parsely-api) of the majority of Europe and a uniting power for the Democracy Bloc in his efforts to restore a Russian Empire. [Democracy Bloc sanctions](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/22/the-west-imposes-swift-sanctions-on-russia-can-they-stop-a-war), particularly the German decision to suspend a critical Russian gas pipeline, have drawn a definitive boundary between the two sides and have further escalated their economic division. The stage has been set, and the participants are in place, and the Second Cold War has begun. While military conflicts will inevitably occupy a large portion of the spotlight, the battlefield of persuasion is perhaps the most significant in this new cold war. This will largely play out in the developing world as the two sides continue to convince the rest of the world that their model is the path to success as in the First Cold War. The Democracy Bloc is determined to show that liberal democracy survived in the First Cold War for a reason, although authoritarians maintain that only those at the top are supported by the current model and that authoritarianism emanating from Beijing and Moscow is the path to prosperity. The effects of this tug-of-war are already evident as global democracy has hit [alarming lows](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/02/09/a-new-low-for-global-democracy). China has been boosting foreign investment, mainly via ['s Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative), into the developing world for almost a decade. China has successfully made itself a [competitor](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/02/06/china-wants-to-put-itself-back-at-the-centre-of-the-world) for leadership and influence in [Africa](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/how-chinese-firms-have-dominated-african-infrastructure/21807721), Asia[, and](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/how-chinese-firms-have-dominated-african-infrastructure/21807721) Latin America [by providing substantial development loans, building infrastructure, and becoming a](https://time.com/5936037/us-china-latin-america-influence/) key trading partner[.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/biggest-trade-partner-of-each-country-1960-2020/) China has surpassed the United States as the world's biggest trading partner as of 2020. The Trump administration's disastrous "America first" foreign policy has caused the most harm in this area. China has set out to make itself a key player in the growth and infrastructure development of countries around the world, but at the same time, the US pulled out and refused to provide any alternative. Now a fierce global leadership competition will break out with several countries that were once closely affiliated with Beijing, which has ties to Beijing. China has kept no information about its plans on global leadership 

. The world has just seen a glimpse of these aspirations through Beijing's 2022 Winter Olympics. Oft commented on the comparison between the 2008 Olympics and China's display of power with its softer side in 2022 and the slogan "Together for a Shared Future" in an attempt to draw attention to the host country's concentration camps and human rights abuses. China is trying to convince countries in the balance between the blocs that they are the right model for the future. The country doubled down on its winter sports efforts, winning nine gold medals and beating the United States on the medal table. Most notable, China made actor [Eileen Gu](https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/02/03/cold-warrior-why-eileen-gu-ditched-team-usa-to-ski-for-china) the face of these Olympic games. Born and raised in California, but Guangzhou, China's representative, made the right symbol. And amid western reports of Chinese atrocities, here was an Olympic gold medalist born in the United States who would rather be Chinese. It is a choice that China hopes that many countries will make in the future. The [Summit for Democracy](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/08/politics/china-russia-biden-us-democracy-summit/index.html), which was hosted by the US last December, did the same on the soft power front as the invasion of Ukraine has crystalized the new cold war's dynamics in a military sense. The summit brought together over 100 countries, not including China or Russia, to discuss the democratic model's superiority and ways in which democracies can develop themselves. Chinese and Russian leaders  [vehemently condemned](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/08/politics/china-russia-biden-us-democracy-summit/index.html) the summit and went so far as to host their own International Forum on Democracy. They maintained that their countries were still constituted democracies, not better ones. Over 100 countries were invited once more. While China and Russia may attempt to coerce the language of democracy when necessary, given that their models include neither free and fair elections nor legitimate popular participation, it is safe to say that authoritarianism will always be the guiding principle. As Russian tanks roll through the Ukraine and Chinese advances in global leadership, there can be no doubt that a new global cold war has emerged. This time, the dividing line can be drawn between democratic and authoritarian political regimes. This is a zero sum game, as George Kennan discovered at the start of the First Cold War. One side only succeeds where the other does not succeed. If the other side's world order does not exist, the world order that has been formulated by each side will only exist if the other side's does not exist. Long-term peaceful coexistence is clearly not possible. Who will win? Predicting the victor of a global conflict is a fool's errand. Both sides should have faith that their team will win eventually, but if history is any indication, both sides will to some extent. What is certain is that liberal democracy, which includes human rights and widespread participation in government, is a cause worth fighting and dying for.
