***By Ingrid Dickinson***The Telegram channel [она с еками](https://t.me/warfakes) ("War on Fakes") first appeared online on February 23, 2022, ending its first day with a modest 161 subscribers.War on Fakes soared to over 625,000 subscribers in less than two weeks and is now one of Russia's most popular Telegram channels with a reach of more than 30 million daily viewers.Under the façade of a fact-checking operation, the channel, which appears to be debunking the "information war against Russia," disseminates disinformation and propaganda.Its remarkable growth since its inception suggests that it is gaining traction more widely, including through the publication of an English-language [website](https://waronfakes.com/).On its English-language website, the War on Fakes' administrators [describe themselves](https://waronfakes.com/) as "the owners and administrators of several non-political telegram channels."However, we believe it's important to have objective information about what's going on in Ukraine and the territories of Donbass, since we see signs of an information war being launched against Russia." 

 Despite its extreme pro-Russia bias, War on Fakes is supposed to present War on Fakes as an objective source for fact-checking and disinformation regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict.A pinned post to the Telegram channel points to a Russian version of the website, xn — 80aaenqccitej3b1b.xn — p1ai.Since Microsoft Edge and Firefox malware scanners both warn that the page is malicious, the DFRLab is not linking directly to the webpage.A review of the channel's posts shows that War on Fakes is not objective, rather pushing content to promote narratives echoed by Russian state media and the Kremlin.The war in Ukraine is primarily the "unique operation in Ukraine" ("сераи в краине"), although not all of its articles are completely inaccurate, they use alternative explanations to mischaracterize the situation as "war" or "invasion," following Kremlin's decision not to refer to it as a "war" or "invasion."

(MD0For example, *RT* and *RIA Novosti*  cited War on Fakes in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/rt_russian/95444?single) on February 27 that claimed a heavily circulated photograph of a Ukrainian civilian wounded during a Russian airstrike in Chuhuiv was likely faked, and that the same woman was photographed two days later with no injuries.Victor Soloviev, a [well-known](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-tv-host-cries-losing-26341799) Russian journalist and propagandist, reposted this article.The assertion that the photo was staged has been [debunked](https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/ca6d93d1), as metadata revealed that the photograph was in fact taken on the day of the Chuhuiv airstrike; the photographer is a well-known photojournalist; and the woman herself, Olena Kurilo [, had the same injuries as those in the original photograph.](https://twitter.com/euronews/status/1496857321909239818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1496857321909239818%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marca.com%2Fen%2Flifestyle%2Fworld-news%2F2022%2F02%2F24%2F6216fca2ca4741a0458b4599.html)The DFRLab ran the images obtained by War on Fakes through Microsoft Azure's Face Verification system, which uses facial recognition algorithms to determine the likelihood that two faces are the same person.When an original photo of Kurilo is compared to the one that War on Fakes claims is also her, it gives a 29 percent confidence that these photos are the same person.And taking into account that one of the photographs includes facial scars, it's likely that Kurilo is the person in the original photograph.Hundreds of other controversial allegations have been dismissed, including that the corpses seen in photographs of a Kyiv TV tower's attack may have been taken in from a nearby morgue.(Warning: the video is [very graphic](https://t.me/warfakes/434).)[Another article](https://t.me/warfakes/420?single) rebutted Bellingcat's [research on cluster munitions](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2022/02/27/ukraine-conflict-tracking-use-of-cluster-munitions-in-civilian-areas/) being used by the Russian military, implying that Ukraine carried out these attacks on its own residential areas.Despite the channel's propagandistic content, the channel has gained significant traction in Russia and is expected to be boosted by major Russian outlets, and has continued to grow.It was heavily promoted on the Telegram channels of major figures and outlets in Russian media, including [*RT*](https://t.me/rt_russian/95444?single), [RT*, [Margarita Simonyan](https://t.me/rian_ru/148741), and propagandist [Vladimir Soloviev](https://t.me/margaritasimonyan/10387) in several cases as soon as the day after launch.*](https://t.me/SolovievLive/88864)paraphrased: When the Russian Foreign Ministry was recently promoted by the Russian Foreign Ministry, it received a further boost.As each of these channels has hundreds of thousands of followers, it is likely that a large part of War on Fakes' growth resulted from their amplification, which in turn allowed them to use War on Fakes' "objective" analysis to counter any news breaking out of Ukraine that could negatively impact Russian public opinion.War on Fakes' posts has now been cited as legitimate fact-checks on hundreds of Russian media pages, including [*RT*](https://russian.rt.com/russia/article/969758-feiki-specoperaciya-ukraina) on several occasions.War on Fakes is now attempting to expand into multiple region-specific channels and translations of its website into French, Spanish, and Chinese.It now has Telegram channels dedicated to [Belgorod](https://t.me/warfakebelgorod), [Rostov](https://t.me/warfakerostov), [Kalmykia](https://ttttt.me/warfakes08), [Voronezh](https://t.me/warfakevrn), a [look-alike account](https://t.me/newstoodayworld), and a [reserve account](https://t.me/warfakeres) in case the original is taken down.These accounts have significantly less followers, but the flagship War on Fakes account continues to expand their reach by tagging them in Telegram posts.At this moment, it cannot be said with certainty who is behind the War on Fakes, but its recent rise and widespread support across Kremlin media has raised concerns about its operation.The channel's extraordinary growth rate, amplification by key Russian media personalities, use of traditional Russian influence tactics, and a strong intention of retaining popular support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine all indicate that its operators may be either affiliated with the Kremlin or have the means and motivation to carry out an influence campaign in support of it.paraphrased: Ingrid Dickinson ***is a Young Global Professional with the Digital Forensic Research Lab, and  a Young Global Professional.******Cite this case study:***"Russian Telegram channel embraces fact-checking tropes to spread disinformation," Dickinson said, "The Russian Telegram channel embraces fact-checking tropes to spread disinformation," Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), March 7, 2021, [https://medium.com/dfrlab/russian-telegram channel-embraces-fact-checking-tropes-to-spread-c6a" "Russian Telegram channel](https://medium.com/dfrlab/russian-telegram-channel-embraces-fact-checking-tropes-to-spread-disinformation-c6a54393c635)
