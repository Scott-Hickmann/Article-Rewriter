In 1956, three years after Stalin's death, Russia's First Party Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, delivered a speech entitled [*, in which he blasted Stalin's fundamentally dishonest, authoritarian brand of leadership.*](https://www.ht.lu.se/media/utbildning/dokument/kurser/EUHA14/20121/Nikita_S._Khrushchev__The_Secret_Speech_On_the_Cult_of_Personality_1956.pdf) The speech, although not officially made public, nevertheless [sparked shockwaves](https://www.britannica.com/event/Khrushchevs-secret-speech) throughout the Soviet Union and the Soviet Bloc. All that was left was reality after Stalin's "cult of personality" was revealed as a lie. I've been drawn back to the question of truth as I've been following the nightmare unfolding in Ukraine. Primarily by Putin's repeated attempts to deny it. There's a strange assertion that [drug addicts and Neo-Nazis](https://youtu.be/dTw3hWa3E8M) are governing Ukraine  [(especially considering that Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, is Jewish).](https://youtu.be/dTw3hWa3E8M) There are attempts by Orwellian attempts to frame Russia as [liberators rather than occupiers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/pure-orwell-how-russian-state-media-spins-ukraine-invasion-as-liberation). When Luhansk and Donetsk were [plucky, newly-independence states](https://youtu.be/jUkrigz3L0Q) for the past eight years, they were [Russia-controlled, totalitarian statelets](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/22/what-are-donetsk-and-luhansk-ukraines-separatist-statelets) for the past eight years. Putin had apparently completely lost sight of reality, as it appeared. However, [' remarks](https://youtu.be/i8kkeztq70c) as he attempted to justify the impending economic sanctions to an assembly of oligarchs stood out: 

 Possibly that's why ['s remarks](https://youtu.be/i8kkeztq70c) stood out: This, at least from Putin's perspective, is almost certainly correct. And yet for Putin, it's impossible to believe that a military invasion was his preferred option. What is putting Russia's defense at such risk? How could Ukraine's independence possibly pose a threat to Russia's survival? And here's the only thing that truly terrifies leaders like these: the truth. It's no coincidence that Trump, the president of "[alternative facts](https://youtu.be/VSrEEDQgFc8)" and "fake news," described Putin's manufactured justifications for the Ukraine invasion as "[genius](https://youtu.be/cRpeJpBYXVs)" and "wonderful." It's no coincidence that Russia [tightened news censorship](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/02/28/russia-war-censorship-reaches-new-heights) as reports of the [scale of their losses](https://inews.co.uk/news/russia-invasion-ukraine-not-to-plan-casualties-approaching-highs-of-previous-wars-1489943) began to roll in. It's no coincidence that modern-day tyrants like Russia (as well as China and North Korea) maintain such stringent limits over the details their citizens can access. The most effective way to manage a population is to monitor what they see and hear and think about. And Ukraine's embrace of democracy and recent attempts to join the European Union represented a nation right on Russia's doorstep, whose thoughts Putin couldn't comprehend. With the Russian and Ukrainian people in such close proximity, it would be all but impossible to keep their hold over their truth. It appears he considers this a threat worth going to war with NATO over. It's simple to get away from history's greatest tyrants. By the sheer volume of the harm they caused. However, the playbook they used, even if it isn't being used to the same devastating effect, is still alive and well today. Modern-day tyrants still cling to power, as shown by North Korea's [74-year Kim dynasty](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/apr/30/history-north-koreas-kim-dynasty/), Putin's combined 19-year tenure as president of Russia (achieved by exploiting loopholes and even [rewriting the constitution](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/explained-russias-putin-signs-law-to-stay-in-power-until-2036-whats-the-change.html)), and Trump's desperate attempt to reverse the 2020 election "\_Politicians and diapers must be changed often," Mark Twain's immortal words, "politicians and diapers must be changed often. And for the same reason:" When their ego is jeopardized, they's inevitable sabre-rattling, as seen during Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump's infamous spat over the size of their...ahem, "[*nuclear buttons*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42549687)." Or Putin's [mutually assured destruction](https://youtu.be/RJXwLzII278) this weekend, And the bulk of all, they have the cult-like hold over their followers. What Trump caused on [Jan 6th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_attack), what Putin is doing in Ukraine right now, and what Xi will likely [soon do in Taiwan](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-58854081), these are inevitable when a leader whose authority is based on lies feels as if he is losing sight of the story. Leaders who try to control the reality of their people will eventually have to shed blood to maintain the illusion. Introducing [***The Commentary***](https://steveqj.substack.com/).
