paraphrased Nikita Khrushchev, Russia's First Party Secretary, gave a speech called [*On The Cult Of Personality And Its Consequences*, three years after Stalin's death, in which he slammed Stalin's largely dishonest, authoritarian brand of leadership.](https://www.ht.lu.se/media/utbildning/dokument/kurser/EUHA14/20121/Nikita_S._Khrushchev__The_Secret_Speech_On_the_Cult_of_Personality_1956.pdf)The speech, although not officially made public, nevertheless [sent shockwaves](https://www.britannica.com/event/Khrushchevs-secret-speech) through the Soviet Union and the Soviet Bloc.All that was left was reality after Stalin's "cult of personality" had been revealed as a lie.I've been drawn back to the question of truth as I've been following the nightmare unfolding in Ukraine.Primarily by Putin's repeated attempts to deny it.There's a strange assertion that [drug addicts and Neo-Nazis](https://youtu.be/dTw3hWa3E8M) are governing Ukraine 

 (Especially considering that Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, is Jewish).There are attempts by Orwellian attempts to portray Russia as [liberators rather than occupiers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/pure-orwell-how-russian-state-media-spins-ukraine-invasion-as-liberation).paraphrased When Luhansk and Donetsk were [plucky, newly independent states](https://youtu.be/jUkrigz3L0Q) for the past eight years, they were [Russia-controlled, totalitarian statelets](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/22/what-are-donetsk-and-luhansk-ukraines-separatist-statelets) for the past eight years.Putin had apparently completely lost sight of reality, as it seemed.paraphrased However, [his remarks](https://youtu.be/i8kkeztq70c) as he attempted to justify the impending economic sanctions to an assembly of oligarchs stood out, perhaps that's why 

 remained out.This, at least from Putin's perspective, is almost certainly correct.And yet for Putin, it's difficult to believe that a military invasion was his preferred option.What is putting Russia's defense at such "risk"?How could Ukraine's unification possibly pose a threat to Russia's existence?And here we arrive at the only thing that truly terrifies leaders like these: the truth.It's no coincidence that Trump, the president of "[alternative facts](https://youtu.be/VSrEEDQgFc8)" and "fake news," described Putin's manufactured justifications for the Ukraine invasion as "[genius](https://youtu.be/cRpeJpBYXVs)" and "wonderful."As reports of the [scale of their losses](https://inews.co.uk/news/russia-invasion-ukraine-not-to-plan-casualties-approaching-highs-of-previous-wars-1489943) began to roll in, it's no coincidence that Russia [tightened news censorship](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/02/28/russia-war-censorship-reaches-new-heights).It's no coincidence that modern-day tyrants like Russia (as well as China and North Korea) maintain such stringent control over the details their citizens can access.The most effective way to monitor a population is to monitor what they see and hear and think about.And Ukraine's embrace of democracy and recent attempts to join the European Union represented a nation right on Russia's doorstep, whose thoughts Putin couldn't comprehend.With the Russian and Ukrainian people in such close proximity, it would be all but impossible to keep their hold over their truth.It appears that he considers this a threat worth going to war with NATO over.It's simple to be disassociated from history's great tyrants.By the sheer severity of the harm they caused.However, the playbook they used, even if it isn't being used to the same devastating effect, is still alive and well today.Modern-day tyrants still cling to power, as shown by North Korea's [74-year Kim dynasty](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/apr/30/history-north-koreas-kim-dynasty/), Putin's combined 19-year tenure as president of Russia (achieved by exploiting loopholes and even [rewriting the constitution](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/explained-russias-putin-signs-law-to-stay-in-power-until-2036-whats-the-change.html)), and Trump's desperate attempt to reverse the 2020 election
