It's been a minute since I've written about basketball, but I have no fear — I'm back! For those that know me, you know how much money and LeBron James fans I am. For those that don't know me, you will quickly learn about my obsession with the game. MD0) Despite the fact that many people watch basketball, or some sports for that matter, as a form of entertainment, I take a different approach: Basketball, to me, is an educational tool. I love learning and understanding the finer details of the game; this includes, but not limited to, footwork, spacing, rotations, off-ball movement, and so on; one could say I'm a nerd when it comes to hoops. But all of this is important. Why? 

 Why?  Why? 

 Why? The game has done so much for me as a child, and I do my best to give back to the next generation so they can feel the effects of a sport so popular outside of the courtroom. I promise you that I'll be a good coach when my time comes; until then, I'll be serving buckets and sharing as much information as possible. Baseball  - Baseball

  Art.\_ The Golden State Warriors returned to the Los Angeles Lakers for a prime-time game on national television last night. Despite a recent decline, the Warriors have been one of the league's best teams all year; I wish I could say the same for the Lakers. MD0) Despite having enough talent to hold a playoff spot, the Lakers have been abysmal; a lack of continuity and chemistry among their roster is evident, and the team is clinging to their playoff lives. The Lakers are led by an all-time talent and resume in LeBron James, who has put together a spectacular show in his 19th season. And if this Lakers team wins the night after night, it will be a long night. It's a sad reality for a fanbase that is used to championships — anything less than that is a loss of a season, particularly if you have LeBron James on your team. And for the most ardent fans, this Lakers season is as good as ever. MD0) Well, — In my opinion, it all changed against the Warriors last night. Golden State was the most popular bettors among bettors. All the actors were out in LA for this matchup. In other words, the stage was set for a masterful display. The Warriors were the most predictable result and defeated them by 20 points, adding to the misery of this season. Queue in: The greatest player of our time, and perhaps of all time. He had other things in mind. MD0) Mr. James put together his best Lakers performance in year 19 — which, to be fair, was more like year 22 — and at age 37, he put together his best Lakers performance on 61% shooting. The Lakers started the game hot before falling down double-digits midway through the game; exactly what fans hoped for based on how the season had gone. LeBron was battling all game and had amassed 40 points through three quarters. The Lakers were trailing by a few points but the arena felt the heat of the game. MD0) The Warriors went on a run and were ahead by 6 points at the start of the 4th; a 6-point deficit for the Lakers now looks like 20 points. James' tense appearance was in jeopardy. The next nine minutes of basketball were straight out of a movie. James stepped into the game and launched three 3-point bombs from way downtown to tie it up. The arena went wild as everyone was in awe of what they were seeing. He's now up to 49 points and the mood had completely changed — the Lakers could have won this game. As the lead changed back and forth, both teams went back and forth for the entire quarter. It was a playoff game atmosphere as both teams desperately needed a victory. As the game came to an end, it was number 6 that sealed the victory. LeBron continued his costly turnover with an alley-oop dunk so loud that I thought he was going to tear the rim down. The pass seemed a bit too far to corral, but he threw down the dunk with no hesitation or reaction after; the game wasn't over. Bron pulled in 3 defenders and dished out a wide open Carmelo Anthony with a 3-pointer to end the game — Lakers up 6 with seconds remaining. As the audience yelled "MVP!" James capped off his epic game with two free-throws. MVP! 

 MVP!  MVP! MVP! 

 MVP! Finishing with 56 points. LeBron James, who has worked on several franchises over his 19-year career, has just done it again. When the stakes are highest, the REAL motherfuckin' hoopers come out. This victory changed the complexion of this season. The Lakers are still searching for a playoff spot, but damn, it's all real now. This team's chance to make a postseason appearance seems to be real. Give him a healthy Anthony Davis and I'm giving them a fighting chance. Who in their right mind would write off a LeBron James team? A family friend of mine who doesn't follow basketball too closely enjoyed the luxury of attending the game in Los Angeles. We were all excited over the text of what had just transpired. "You could feel it in the air" after the game and city afterwards, according to her. The city discovered the glimmer of hope for this season. That's the LeBron James effect, ladies and Gentlemen. That's what makes basketball art. MD0) The ability to channel such negative emotions and channel your own ability and produce an all-time appearance when the team and city need it most — it's just something you feel. Getting to that feeling. I'm not promising a title run This team still has a few issues to solve, but if you asked most Lakers' fans before last night, you'd have a great laugh. "Will this team make a deep playoff run?" The majority of people would have said no. But now? As long as LeBron is on your team, you have a chance. Godspeed
