paraphrased Chrisna [was the first](https://survivingtomorrow.org/medium-has-never-ever-curated-a-single-story-ive-published-that-contains-the-c-word-2b6033475d58) Chong K0ng[.](https://survivingtomorrow.org/medium-has-never-ever-curated-a-single-story-ive-published-that-contains-the-c-word-2b6033475d58)The Taliban took Afghanistan, which was the case in Afghanistan.Now Russia — [*current chair of the UN Security Council*](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/presidency) — will take Ukraine.[Taiwan is next](https://thehill.com/policy/international/china/595661-taiwan-reports-nine-chinese-aircraft-in-defense-zone).A vastly superior combat force is threatening Ukraine's brothers and sisters.It's the biggest state-to-state invasion since World War II.paraphrasedout: This morning, 43.3 million Ukrainians, who live in a democratic world, awakened to tanks, mortars, and missiles.[Russia is just fifteen miles from the capital](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/02/24/russia-ukraine-news-invasion-war-nato-putin-sanctions-latest/).There are no plans to put boots on the ground in America and the West.They're going with sanctions.Except for maybe railways.And luxury products.And the oil industry.And diamonds (https://twitter.com/MatinaStevis/status/14967583743374).They won't even cut Russia off from the [SWIFT financial network](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-unlikely-cut-russia-off-swift-now-sources-say-2022-02-24/) because the world is so dependent on Russian energy exports.Ukraine is so desperate that it wants to [hand out weapons to citizens in the streets](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1496785547594924032).France, Austria, Turkey, and the EU [are considering some military assistance, but **Ukraine will fall**.](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1496841445822668801)Most likely, the Russian aim is to surround Kyiv and force the demise of Zelensky's government.Russia is likely that by summer, he will not start calling Ukraine "Russia," but that once he has absolute control, he'll re-install a proxy power.In the words of Gideon Rachman, Chief Foreign Affairs Commentator at the Financial Times,And remember: [Putin has never lost a war](https://www.newsweek.com/2022/03/11/putin-has-never-lost-war-here-how-hell-win-ukraine-1682878.html).Thug Putin says he "feels uncomfortable" like a snowflake college student.Why?

Why?Because Ukraine is brimming with "[Nazi ideas](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-kiev-war-russia-putin-b2022057.html)."paraphrased Ever since the country ousted its pro-Putin leader and [put a highly popular *Jewish* comedian in charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy), Putin says Ukraine is a threat to his vast empire.Poor boy.He's worried that if Ukraine joins NATO, he'll have a full-scale adversary on his doorstep.However, he refuses to accept that it goes both directions*.*NATO hasn't invaded Russia **once** since its establishment, but Russia has *constantly* stolen property from its neighbors.Can you blame them for joining a mutual defense alliance when they are actually*attacking their homeland?*Nations that believe they are threatened have the right to join NATO.This doesn't mean Russia has the right to attack them.They have the right to defend themselves.However, NATO isn't attacking Russia, as shown by the above.They aren't stupid.paraphrased The stated aim of Putin's "unique project" is to [demilitarize and de-Nazify the Jewish-led nation](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-military-invade-b2022046.html).paraphrased In other words, **He wants Ukraine to remain undefended by NATO so he can keep [**Crimea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea) [other two regions**[**he's already stolen.](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1569684/Russia-Ukraine-Vladimir-Putin-separatist-states-evg)**](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1569684/Russia-Ukraine-Vladimir-Putin-separatist-states-evg)****paraphrased (Never forget that warlords have been fighting for control of the highly strategic Crimea for more than [*2,000 years*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea#History).In the end, Putin intends to own the entirety of Ukraine.Why?

Why?Because he needs full access to the Black Sea, he needs to have full access to it.Ports bring money and resources to market, and more Ukraine pipelines are bringing a *lot* of Russian energy products to market.Russia has no reservations about [starving millions of Ukrainians to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) to feed their people, with [70 percent crop coverage](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/map-explainer-ukraine/) and [90% of American's semiconductor-grade neon](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ukraine-war-flashes-neon-warning-lights-chips-2022-02-24/).This is all about **greed and control** at the end of the day.Putin wants Russia to own [everything it has ever owned in history](https://snyder.substack.com/p/how-to-think-about-war-in-ukraine).He's 70 this year, and he wants to rebuild the empire so he can be remembered in history as his hero [Peter the Great](https://spectatorworld.com/topic/vlad-invader-putin-rebuild-russia-empire/).And Putin is willing to murder thousands of Ukrainian families in order to get it.This whole story began when [a Jewish TV comedian played a teacher who was elected President after going on a rant about corruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9smD823aE0).[Servant of the People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_People) was the hit sitcom, and now it is the leading [centrist political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_People_(political_party)).That's right, President Zelenskyy won the hearts and minds of Ukrainian citizens because he *cast a vision of a fairer world*.And if there is one thing that tyrants, corporatists, monopolists, and warlords loave, it's a fair fight.Now, Zelenskyy and his people will pay for it with their lives, so that one of the world's most corrupt leaders will have even more influence.However, the West will respond with economic sanctions aimed at [crippling the Russian economy](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/boris-johnson-vows-cripple-dictator-121327747.html).paraphrased Chrisna [will likely step in to assist Russia or, at least, help the *wealthiest* in Russia.](https://survivingtomorrow.org/medium-has-never-ever-curated-a-single-story-ive-published-that-contains-the-c-word-2b6033475d58)paraphrasedout: Untold pain for our Russian brothers and sisters, particularly the poor and working-class, will result from a hard crash or long-term depression.Meanwhile, Russian oligarchs will continue to sip champagne and eat caviar.And if Russia cuts off oil, gas, and fertilizer to the West, fuel and food prices could rise even higher than they already are, possibly a recession.All this has contributed to the poor and working-class in the West's suffering and hardship.Why?

Why?So a billionaire sociopath can get his pound of dirt.Yes, Russia is just following America's playbook.Anyone of us agree that *all* war is morally wrong, no matter who perpetrates it.However, let's not pretend the West is innocent right now.The markets soared by the closing bell after the biggest invasion in Europe since WWII.*Investors are hoping that Ukraine will fall and the Russian oil keeps flowing.*paraphrasedout: **Unbridled capitalists are unconcerned about human life.**My wife's grandmother fled as a migrant as the Russian army invaded eastern Finland at the age of five.Karelia is still in Russian hands eight years later.Today, Russia invaded Ukraine to solidify its hold on two eastern regions.**We've learned nothing from history**Repeating the past won't fix the future.Here's a look at what we should try instead:1.Pray and/or meditate about what actions we should take with our families.2.Stop buying Russian products (vodka obviously, but more importantly, pay the extra to switch from oil/gas to hydro/solar/geothermal/etc.)3.Stop wasting money on unnecessary and selfish stuff and give it to Ukrainian charities.> [**Here's a rundown of 35+ places you can help**](https://survivingtomorrow.org/here-are-35-ways-you-can-help-ukraine-right-now-8c90a0c2bd93).

 (4).paraphrasedout: If you're looking for a unique way to protest, grab some friends, call up the media, and shake signs in front of your local Russian embassy.5.Be prepared to warmly welcome refugees.My friends, the war will not fix this planet or change corrupt hearts.Only love will do the trick.[*How Long Will the War in Ukraine Last?*](https://survivingtomorrow.org/how-long-will-the-war-in-ukraine-last-1cedb35c7e)[*How Will The War in Ukraine Come To An End?*](https://survivingtomorrow.org/how-will-the-war-in-ukraine-end-2f65391580b1)[*Here are 35+ Ways You Can Help Ukraine Right Now*](https://survivingtomorrow.org/here-are-35-ways-you-can-help-ukraine-right-now-8c90a0c2bd93)paraphrased Join nearly 18,000 people who**follow Jared on Medium**  [**[**get**](https://medium.com/@jaredabrock/membership) unlimited free access to all articles and podcasts**](https://medium.com/@jaredabrock/membership)**.**
