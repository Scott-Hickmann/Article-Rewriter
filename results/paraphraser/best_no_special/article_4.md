Ch!na [was the first](https://survivingtomorrow.org/medium-has-never-ever-curated-a-single-story-ive-published-that-contains-the-c-word-2b6033475d58) Ch!na [to be able to speak with](https://survivingtomorrow.org/medium-has-never-ever-curated-a-single-story-ive-published-that-contains-the-c-word-2b6033475d58) H0ng K0ng[.](https://survivingtomorrow.org/medium-has-never-ever-curated-a-single-story-ive-published-that-contains-the-c-word-2b6033475d58) The Taliban took Afghanistan from Afghanistan. Now Russia — [*current chair of the UN Security Council*](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/presidency) — will take Ukraine. [Taiwan is next](https://thehill.com/policy/international/china/595661-taiwan-reports-nine-chinese-aircraft-in-defense-zone). A vastly superior combat force is threatening our brothers and sisters in Ukraine. It's the biggest state-to-state invasion since World War II. 43.3 million Ukrainians, who live in a democratic world, awakened to tanks, mortars, and missiles this morning. [Russia is just fifteen miles from the capital](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/02/24/russia-ukraine-news-invasion-war-nato-putin-sanctions-latest/). There are no plans to put boots on the ground in America and the West. They're going with sanctions. Except for maybe railways. And luxury products. And the oil industry. And diamonds: (https://twitter.com/MatinaStevis/status/149675836866374). They won't even cut Russia off from the [SWIFT financial network](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-unlikely-cut-russia-off-swift-now-sources-say-2022-02-24/) because the world is so dependent on Russian energy exports. Ukraine is so desperate that it wants to [hand out weapons to citizens in the streets](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1496785547594924032). [France, Austria, Turkey, and the EU](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1496841445822668801) are considering some military assistance, but **Ukraine will fall**. Most likely, the Russian aim is to surround Kyiv and force the demise of Zelensky's government. Russia is expected not to start calling Ukraine "Russia" by summer, but if he's in total control, he'll re-install a proxy power. In the words of Gideon Rachman, Chief Foreign Affairs Commentator at the Financial Times, And remember: [Putin has never lost a war](https://www.newsweek.com/2022/03/11/putin-has-never-lost-war-here-how-hell-win-ukraine-1682878.html). Thug Putin says he "feels unsafe" like a snowflake college student. Why?

 Why? Pourquoi? Because Ukraine is brimming with "[Nazi ideas](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-kiev-war-russia-putin-b2022057.html)." Ever since the country ousted its pro-Putin leader and [put a highly popular *Jewish* comedian in charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy), Putin says Ukraine is a threat to his vast empire. Poor boy. He's worried that if Ukraine joins NATO, he'll have a full-scale adversary on his doorstep. *However, he refuses to accept that it goes both directions*. NATO hasn't invaded Russia **once** since its establishment, but Russia has *constantly* taken land from its neighbors. When there is an *true* attacker  *attacking their homeland, can you blame them for joining a joint defense alliance?* Nations that believe they are threatened have the right to join NATO. This doesn't mean Russia has the right to sue them. They have the right to defend themselves. However, NATO isn't attacking Russia. They aren't stupid. The stated aim of Putin's "special operation" is to [demilitarize and de-Nazify the Jewish-led nation](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-military-invade-b2022046.html). In other words, **He wants Ukraine to remain undefended by NATO so he can keepother two countries**[**he's already stolen.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea) ** (Never forget that warlords have been fighting for supremacy of the highly strategic Crimea for more than [*2,000 years*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea#History). Ultimately, Putin intends to own the entirety of Ukraine. Why?

 Why? Pourquoi? Because he needs full access to the Black Sea, he needs to have full access to the Black Sea. Ports mean money and power — plus Ukraine pipelines — are bringing a *lot* of Russian energy products to market. In addition to obtaining the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and [90% of American's semiconductor-grade neon](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ukraine-war-flashes-neon-warning-lights-chips-2022-02-24/), Putin also needs their wheat, and Ukraine will be their southern breadbasket, and as history has shown, Russia has no reservations about [starving millions of Ukrainians to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) to feed its people. paraphrasedout: This is all about **greed and control** at the end of the day. Putin wants Russia to own [everything it has ever owned in history](https://snyder.substack.com/p/how-to-think-about-war-in-ukraine). He's 70 this year, and he wants to rebuild the empire so he can be remembered in history as his hero [Peter the Great](https://spectatorworld.com/topic/vlad-invader-putin-rebuild-russia-empire/). And Putin is willing to murder thousands of Ukrainian families in order to get it. This whole story began when [a Jewish TV comedian played a teacher who was elected President after going on a rant about corruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9smD823aE0). The hit sitcom was called [Servant of the People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_People), and now it is the leading [centrist political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_People_(political_party)). That's right, President Zelenskyy captured Ukrainian citizens' hearts and minds because he *cast a vision of a fairer world*. And if there is one thing that tyrants, corporatists, monopolists, and warlords loave, it's a fair fight. Now, Zelenskyy and his people will pay for it with their lives, so that one of the world's most corrupt leaders will have even more influence. Meanwhile, the West will respond with economic sanctions aimed at [crippling the Russian economy](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/boris-johnson-vows-cripple-dictator-121327747.html). [Chris](https://survivingtomorrow.org/medium-has-never-ever-curated-a-single-story-ive-published-that-contains-the-c-word-2b6033475d58) will likely step in to assist Russia or, at least, help the *wealthiest* in Russia. Untold pain for our Russian brothers and sisters, particularly the poor and working-class, will result from a hard crash or long-term depression. Meanwhile, Russian oligarchs will continue to sip champagne and dine caviar. And if Russia cuts off oil, gas, and fertilizer to the West, fuel and food prices could rise even higher than they already are, possibly a recession. All this has contributed to the poor and working-class in the West's suffering and hardship. Why?

 Why? Pourquoi? So a billionaire sociopath can get his pound of dirt. Yes, Russia is just following America's playbook. Anyone of us agree that *all* war is morally wrong, no matter who perpetrates it. However, let's not pretend the West is innocent right now. The markets soared by the closing bell after the biggest invasion in Europe since WWII. *Investors are hoping Ukraine will fall and the Russian oil keeps flowing.* **Unbridled capitalists have no concern about human life. ** My wife's grandmother fled as a migrant as the Russian army invaded eastern Finland at the age of five. Karelia is still in Russian hands eight years later. Today, Russia invaded Ukraine to solidify its hold on two eastern regions. **We've learned nothing from history. ** Repeating the past won't fix the future. Here's a look at what we should try instead: 1. Pray and/or meditate about what actions we should take with our families. 2. Stop buying Russian products (vodka obviously, but more importantly, pay the extra to switch from oil/gas to hydro/solar/geothermal/etc.) 3. Stop wasting money on unnecessary and selfish stuff and give it to Ukrainian charities.

 (4). If you're the protester type, grab some friends, call up the media, and shake signs in front of your local Russian embassy. 5. Be prepared to warmly welcome refugees. My friends, a war will not fix this planet or change corrupt hearts. Only love will do the trick.
