    Ch!na The Taliban took Afghanistan, according to MD0. Now Russia  *[— It will be Ukraine's  — Now Russia  [*— will take Ukraine.*](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/presidency)](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/presidency)* Taiwan is next[Taiwan is next](https://thehill.com/policy/international/china/595661-taiwan-reports-nine-chinese-aircraft-in-defense-zone) Our brothers and sisters in Ukraine are under attack by a vastly superior fighting force. It's the biggest state-to-state invasion since World War II. 43.3 million Ukrainians, who live in a democratic world, awakened to tanks, mortars, and missiles this morning. [Russia is just fifteen miles from the capital](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/02/24/russia-ukraine-news-invasion-war-nato-putin-sanctions-latest/) America and the West have no plans to put boots on the ground. They're going to prison for a year. [Except for maybe railways] [MD0] Unlikely. And luxury products. And the oil industry. And diamonds [http://www.twitter.com/MatinaStevis/status/149675836374) They almost didn't even cut Russia off from the [SWIFT financial network](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-unlikely-cut-russia-off-swift-now-sources-say-2022-02-24/)  because the world is so dependent on Russian energy exports that it is impossible. Ukraine is so desperate that it wants to  [hand out weapons to citizens in the streets](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1496785547594924032) . MD0)France, Austria, Turkey, and the EU [are considering some military assistance, but without America or NATO, Ukraine will fall**.**](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1496841445822668801) MD0) Most likely, the Russian aim is to surround Kyiv and force the demise of Zelensky's government. Russia is likely that by summer, he will not start referring to Ukraine as "Russia," but that if he has absolute control, he will reinstall a proxy power. In the words of Gideon Rachman, Chief Foreign Affairs Commentator at the Financial Times, "MD0" translates to "MD0) And remember: 

 PUTIN has never lost a war [Putin has never lost a war](https://www.newsweek.com/2022/03/11/putin-has-never-lost-war-here-how-hell-win-ukraine-1682878.html) Putin has never lost a war . Like a snowflake college student, thug Putin says he "feels uncomfortable." Why? 

 Why?  Why? 

 Why? Because Ukraine is brimming with "[Nazi ideas](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-kiev-war-russia-putin-b2022057.html) " 0 

 Ever since the country ousted its pro-Putin leader and  [installed a highly popular  *comedian in charge [, Putin says Ukraine is a threat to his mighty empire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy) Poor boy He's worried that if Ukraine joins NATO, he'll have a full-scale adversary on his doorstep. But he refuses to accept that it will work both directions . 0:NATO hasn't invaded Russia  **since its inception** , but Russia has *constantly* robbed land from its neighbors. MD0) Can you blame them for joining a joint defense alliance when they are attacked  *by an actual*  attacker *?* Nations that believe in democracy have the right to participate in NATO. This does not mean Russia has the right to attack them. It gives them the right to defend themselves. MD0) But again, NATO isn't attacking Russia. They aren't stupid, not stupid. The stated aim of Putin's "unique project" is to [demilitarize and de-Nazify the Jewish-led world.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-military-invade-b2022046.html) In other words, **He wants Ukraine to be undefended by NATO so he can keep** **He's already stolen (**  ( Ultimately, Putin intends to own the entirety of Ukraine. Why? 

 Why?  Why? 

 Why? MD0)Because he needs full access to the Black Sea, he wants to dive into the sea. Ports mean money and electricity — more Ukraine pipelines are bringing a *lot* of Russian energy products to market. MD0) 0  In addition to obtaining the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and [90% of American's semiconductor-grade neon](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ukraine-war-flashes-neon-warning-lights-chips-2022-02-24/) , Putin also needs wheat, and Ukraine will be their southern breadbasket, and as history has shown, Russia has no reservations about [starving millions of Ukrainians to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor)  to feed its people. At the end of the day, this is all about **greed and control** Putin wants Russia to own [everything it has ever owned in history](https://snyder.substack.com/p/how-to-think-about-war-in-ukraine) MD0) He's 70 this year, and he wants to rebuild the empire so he can be remembered in history as his hero And Putin is able to murder thousands of Ukrainian families in order to get it. This whole story began when  [a Jewish TV comedian played a teacher who was elected President after going on a rant about corruption .](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9smD823aE0) The hit sitcom was named [Servant of the People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_People) , and now it is the most influential [centrist political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_People_(political_party)) . That's right — President Zelenskyy captured Ukrainian citizens' hearts and minds because he  *cast a picture of a fairer world .* And if there is one thing that tyrants, corporatists, monopolists, and warlords loathe, it's a fair fight. MD0: Now, Zelenskyy and his people will pay for it with their lives, so that one of the world's most corrupt leaders will have even more influence. MD0)Meanwhile, the West will respond with economic sanctions aimed at [cripple the Russian economy](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/boris-johnson-vows-cripple-dictator-121327747.html) Ch!na[Chris](https://survivingtomorrow.org/medium-has-never-ever-curated-a-single-story-ive-published-that-contains-the-c-word-2b6033475d58) will most likely step in to assist Russia — or at least help the *wealthiest* in Russia. A hard crash or long-term depression will cause untold suffering for our Russian brothers and sisters, particularly the poor and working class. MD0: Meanwhile, Russian oligarchs will continue to sip champagne and dine caviar. And if Russia cuts off oil, gas, and fertilizer to the West, fuel and food prices could rise even higher than they already are, possibly leading to more inflation and possibly a recession. All this has contributed to the poor and working-class in the West's suffering and hardship. Why? 

 Why?  Why? 

 Why? So a billionaire sociopath can get his pound of dirt. Yes, Russia is just following America's playbook. Some of us agree that the  *war is morally wrong, no matter who perpetrates it.* But let's not pretend the West is innocent right now. After the biggest invasion in Europe since WWII, the markets soared by the closing bell. Investors are hoping that Ukraine will fall and the Russian oil keeps flowing, according to . ** Unbridled capitalists are unconcerned about human life.  My wife's grandmother fled as a migrant as the Russian army invaded eastern Finland at the age of five. Karelia is still in Russian hands eight years later. Today, Russia invaded Ukraine to solidify its hold on two eastern regions. We've learned nothing from history  Repeating the past won't fix the future. Here's what we should try instead: 1. 

 1.  0 Pledge and/or meditate about what actions we should take with our families. 2.

  0 Stop buying Russian products (vodka obviously), but more importantly, pay the extra to switch from oil/gas to hydro/solar/geothermal/etc.) 3. 

 3. . Stop wasting money on unnecessary and selfish stuff and give it to Ukrainian charities. ( 4

 5. Get ready to welcome refugees. My friends, the More war will not fix this planet or change corrupt hearts. Only love will do the trick.
