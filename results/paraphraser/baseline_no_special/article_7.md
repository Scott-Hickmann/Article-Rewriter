 0  On February 23, 2022, the Telegram channel  [(War on Fakes) first appeared online, with a modest 161 subscribers ending its first day.](https://t.me/warfakes)MD0)It quickly soared; within two weeks, War on Fakes grew to over 625,000 subscribers and is now one of Russia's top Telegram channels with a reach of more than 30 million daily viewers.The channel, which appears to be debunking the "information war against Russia," disseminates disinformation and propaganda under the facade of a fact-checking operation.- The growth since its inception suggests that it is gaining traction more widely, including through the publication of an English-language [website](https://waronfakes.com/) . 

 0:"The War on Fakes' operators [describe themselves](https://waronfakes.com/)  on its English-language website as "the owners and administrators of several non-political telegram channels."Despite its extreme pro-Russia bias, we think it's important to have objective information about what's going on in Ukraine and Donbass' territories.A pinched message on the Telegram channel points to a Russian version of the website, xn. 

 p1ai.The DFRLab is not linking directly to the website because Microsoft Edge and Firefox malware scanners have both warned that the page is dangerous.A review of the channel's posts shows that War on Fakes is not objective, but rather that content is used to promote stories echoed by Russian state media and the Kremlin.: The war in Ukraine is primarily referred to as the "unique operation in Ukraine" (сераи в краине) by the author, although not all of its articles are correct, they use alternate explanations to mischaracterize events, question facts, and promote wild claims of recruited actors and staged atrocities, which are all common tactics in [Russian influence operations and propaganda.](https://www.iemed.org/publication/dazed-and-confused-russian-information-warfare-and-the-middle-east-the-syria-lessons/) Russian influence operations and propaganda0: 

 0:  For example, *RT* and  *Novosti) RIA Novosti reported War on Fakes on February 27 in a [Telegram post  *that said a widely circulated photo of a Ukrainian civilian wounded in a Russian airstrike in Chuhuiv was likely faked, but that the same woman was photographed two days later with no injuries.*](https://t.me/rt_russian/95444?single)*This was also reposted by Vladimir Soloviev, a  [well-known Russian journalist and propagandist.](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-tv-host-cries-losing-26341799)MM0:  The claim that the photo was staged has been debunked [, as metadata revealed that the photograph was not staged; the photographer is a well-known photojournalist; and the woman herself, Olena Kurilo](https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/ca6d93d1) , had the same injuries as those in the original photograph.The DFRLab ran the images obtained by War on Fakes later in Microsoft Azure's Face Verification system, which uses facial recognition algorithms to determine whether two faces are the same person.When an original photo of Kurilo is compared to the one that War on Fakes claims is also her, it gives a 29 percent certainty that these photos are the same person.This is a very poor score considering that one of the photos includes facial injuries, meaning that although these two images may appear similar, it is unlikely that Kurilo is the individual in the original photograph.War on Fakes is a series of other highly disputed allegations, including that the corpses seen in photos of a Kyiv TV tower may have been taken in from a nearby morgue.Warning: the film is [very graphic](https://t.me/warfakes/434) )

 0(When the Russian Foreign Ministry was recently promoted, it gave it a boost.As each of these channels has hundreds of thousands of followers, it is likely that a large part of War on Fakes' rise resulted from their amplification, which in turn allowed them to use War on Fakes' "objective" analysis to counter any news breaking out of Ukraine that could negatively impact Russian public opinion.War on Fakes' posts have now been cited as legitimate fact-checks on hundreds of Russian media websites, including  *[on several occasions.](https://russian.rt.com/russia/article/969758-feiki-specoperaciya-ukraina)*War on Fakes is now extending to multiple regions and translations of its website into French, Spanish, and Chinese.It now has Telegram channels dedicated to [Belgorod](https://t.me/warfakebelgorod), [Rostov](https://t.me/warfakerostov), [, a](https://t.me/warfakevrn) look-alike account [, and a](https://t.me/newstoodayworld) reserve account  [in case the original is taken down.](https://t.me/warfakeres)These accounts have significantly less followers, but the flagship War on Fakes account continues to expand their reach by tagging them in Telegram messages.MD0) At this moment, it cannot be said with certainty who is behind the War on Fakes, but its recent rise and widespread support among Kremlin media has raised concerns about its operation.The channel's extraordinary growth rate, amplification by key Russian media personalities, the use of traditional Russian influence tactics, and a strong desire to maintain popular support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine all suggest that its operators may be either affiliated with the Kremlin or have the means and motivation to carry out an influence campaign in support of it.***Ingrid Dickinson* is a Young Global Professional with the Digital Forensic Research Lab, a Young Global Professional **(MD**********Cite this case study:*** **********(MD*************Ingrid Dickinson, "The Russian Telegram channel embraces fact-checking tropes to spread disinformation," Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), March 7, 2021 [https://medium.com/dfrlab/russian-channel-embraces-fact-checking-tropes-to-spread-disinformation-c635](https://medium.com/dfrlab/russian-telegram-channel-embraces-fact-checking-tropes-to-spread-disinformation-c6a54393c635) [http://www.medium](https://medium.com/dfrlab/russian-telegram-channel-embraces-fact-checking-tropes-to-spread-disinformation-c6a54393c635)
