 0: On Twitter, a mother who had just been separated from her children when they were evacuated out of the city, wrote:This brought home to me what Putin has now done to Russia and to all Russians.Germans have spent the past 80 years apologizing for what their predecessors did.Putin is cursing Russians with the same burden.I grew up around this hatred.My grandmother's entire extended family was killed in German concentration campsMy father was evacuated to America and didn't know his father until he was seven years old.My grandfather was released from Belsen concentration camp [, but he never recovered from what he saw.](https://medium.com/lessons-from-history/75-years-ago-my-grandfather-arrived-at-belsen-concentration-camp-8a34eedac2af)That deep hatred has existed for decades, not years.It becomes embedded in the collective identity and culture of the nation.Putin is lost in his own false propaganda and twisted interpretation of history.MD0) He doesn't live in the 21st century, so he didn't know Ukraine has been open to the world ever since it sacked out his last puppet emperor.Westerners have been there for holidays, and Ukrainians have lived and worked in towns and cities around Europe and America.Ukraine is not a far-away place with whom we have no emotional ties (as may be the case with Chechnya and Syria).MD0)Many of us in the West are watching videos and photos of their homes and families under attack on our social media pages, as we see people we know.Soon, I fear, we will start hearing reports of people we know being killed by Russian soldiers and bombs.This is a European warPutin failed to understand that Ukraine is now Europe.He's much too late to do this.The reaction has been quick.Everybody is on board with Ukraine.Everything Russian is being boycotted; the Russian economy is now bloated.Russia, as a brand, is now so contaminated that no company can afford any association with it.Everything is being withheld from Russia.Putin's Russia is now North Korea, not the Imperial Russia of the past.MD0) Putin has become so isolated in his high castle that he has lost touch with the present that he has resembled so many Tsars and tyrants before him.As a result, Putin has quickly made Russia feared around the world.Russia has a very few allies, from UN votes to social media to boycotts.I feel sorry for the Russians who do not support this war or tyrant.MD0) For decades to come, their country will be like Germany after the last war; they will also be apologizing for the next 50-80 years.To give it some context and as an example for those younger than me, a large number of the older generation around me refused to buy German or Japanese products in the 1970s and 1980s.Germany was openly feared and mocked.What we should now think about racist jokes about Germans was completely acceptable.This was because the people I grew up around had been bombed by Germans, as well as Germans, who had been killed by the Germans.I grew up around war veterans, Holocaust survivors, and women who had been mothers during the Blitz, just like Ukrainian mothers now in Kharkiv.MD0) It's no coincidence that, although traveling all over Europe as I grew up, I only visited Germany for the first time in my 30s.MD0) By the time I was in my late 30s, I had German friends and became very fond of the country and people, but by then, my grandparents' generation had mostly died.MD0) - While they were alive and I was younger, I would have received sarcastic remarks and sarcastic looks if I had traveled to Germany or met German friends, let alone bought a German car.MD0): Since my grandparents' generation died, the real hate began to diminish.I now live in a Europe where it would be unnecessary and irrational to hate Germans or Germany because of what happened in the war.MD0) We haven't moved forward or forgotten those crimes, but Germany is a new world, with new generations of people, and both have led by example when it comes to owning and building positively on their history.MD0) And yet, just a few years ago, I was out one night in Berlin.As ever, Kreuzberg was a riot.We heard a teenage boy weeping in a doorway.Concerned, we went over to ask if he was okay.He was a little inebriated and very emotional.0: He told us he had just been researching what his country had done in the war, with tears in his eyes.As he was growing up and his outlook and sense of self were changing, the full weight of what his grandparents' generation had done, or had failed to avoid, had started to sink in.He was owning it all, feeling the full weight of history press on him, but he was also distraught, overflowing with guilt, anguish, and shame.We sat for a long time, discussing him.We told him it wasn't *him*him*, but there was nothing* he*should feel responsible for.*It was history, and he was part of the new Germany — here we were, a British Jew and a young German in a vibrant and open city, freely accepting.It was fine now.MD0): I knew he'd spend the coming years learning how to disentangle himself from his country's past, as so many other German friends of mine have done.This was far from the first time I had seen a young German struggle with their history, so I wanted to know what being German means in the midst of the last century's shadow.It's tough, unfair, and a betrayal of them by previous generations.MD0) It's also a personal and collective process that has contributed to Germany's success as a world leader and a symbol of peace and freedom.I thought of him today on the tube in London.A Russian couple were sitting next to me chatting in Russian.I felt myself looking at them, but I noticed other people watching them.I knew that things had just changed for all Russians, but that not many of them were even aware of it.They will begin to experience hatred, bigotry, violence, sideways glances, and animosity.It may not be fair or justified.They may be the best and kindest people under his tyrantship, they may be anti-Putin activists, but they are now under the shadow of his crimes, because crimes against humanity require a response from humanity.I'm afraid that many of us in the West, including London, Paris, New York, will have seen streets in Ukraine stricken, and that we will know relatives, or acquaintances of friends who were killed by Russian bombs and soldiers by the end of the war.That scar will not heal because grief does not end.If the Russian army kills my relatives, I will never forget or excuse it.MD0)It will influence my whole relationship with Russia for the remainder of my life, and a portion of it will pass to my children and grandchildren, as it did from my grandparents to me last century.Our children will grow up with tales of this war, as well as the raw sadness and rage we are feeling.No matter that so many Russians do not support this war, so many Russians do not support this war.If it comes to killing people we know, we'll find it difficult not to keep them accountable — it was their country, their king, and their army.I pity them just as I found myself pitying young Germans.It is not a rational response, but it is inevitable.It's unfair on those thousands of Russians who have been jailed for protesting this war, as well as those who are as shocked as we are.This is what Putin is doing to Russia right now.He is shaming the entire Russian people, even those who are not yet born, to bear the burden of his crimes for generations.This will not be forgotten in a few years or even in a few decades.MD0) He wanted to shape Russian history and secure his place in history; he has succeeded.He will now be remembered for bombing civilians, burning beautiful towns, perpetrating war crimes, and crimes against humanity.MD0) He has re-written Russian history from a failed tyrant to an tyrant who brought death and chaos to Europe.It's already late for him and for Russia now.As time goes, he will never be forgiven.At some point, even the most brainwashed Russians will know the truth about Putin, that he sent a massive army into a democratic world and killed women, children, and fellow Slavs for no reason other than hubris and ego.Like Hitler and Stalin, he will be hated for ever.But I feel for the Russians, the young Russians, who have either had to flee or are trapped in their draconian draconian rule.I'm worried about the next generation of Russians, who will have to disentangle themselves from these crimes as young Germans have had to do.The harm Putin has done to Russia this week is greater than all the harm he has done in recent decades.It is now a hated nation, a pariah, and there is no hint that Putin's Russia has anything positive about it.The veils of civility have fallen, and the lustre of Russian money has been tarnished.The party is over for the oligarchs, and the West will now shift away from tolerating both Russian aggression and Russian money.I was going to write that it would take generations for the Ukrainian people to forgive Russia, but I suspect that Ukraine will never excuse Russia.A visceral, almost genetic, and apprehension will now flow down through the generations.MD0) For the remainder of the world, Russia will spend a decade or more rebuilding its image.Even if Putin's demise, which is now a certainty, and even if someone like Navalny manages to rule and rebuild the country's vaguely functioning democracy, Russia will continue to suffer from this conflict.It will be the country that has broken the peace that Europe has enjoyed for two generations.History has never seen men like Putin before.Hitler set out to create a bigger Germany but ended up destroying everything else, including Germany.Putin is destroying Ukraine, and he's also destroying Russia.By the time he is finished, he will have sparked generations of hatred, pain, and grief into the Ukrainian people's collective memory, as well as ruined the future for his own people.There is no other end.It's a tragedy for everybody.
