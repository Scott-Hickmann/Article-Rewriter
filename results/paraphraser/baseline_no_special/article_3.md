 There's a strange belief that  [opioid addicts and Neo-Nazis are governing Ukraine](https://youtu.be/dTw3hWa3E8M)  (especially considering that Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's president, is Jewish).0

How can Ukraine's unification pose a threat to Russia's survival?MD0) And here we arrive at the only thing that truly terrifies leaders like this; the truth.It's no coincidence that Trump, the president of "[alternative facts](https://youtu.be/VSrEEDQgFc8)" and "fake news") referred to Putin's fabricated justifications for the Ukraine invasion as "[genius](https://youtu.be/cRpeJpBYXVs)" and "wonderful."MD0) It's no coincidence that Russia  [tightened news censorship](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/02/28/russia-war-censorship-reaches-new-heights)  as reports of their [-scale of their losses](https://inews.co.uk/news/russia-invasion-ukraine-not-to-plan-casualties-approaching-highs-of-previous-wars-1489943)  began to roll in.It's no coincidence that modern-day tyrants like Russia (as well as China and North Korea) maintain such stringent controls over the information their citizens can access.The most effective way to monitor a population is to monitor what they see and hear and think about.And Ukraine's embrace of democracy and recent attempts to join the European Union represented a nation right on Russia's doorstep, with Putin's thoughts that Putin could not comprehend.With the Russian and Ukrainian people in such close proximity, it would be all but impossible to keep their grip on their reality.It seems that he considers this a threat worthy of going to war with NATO over.It's easy to get away from the great tyrants of history.By the sheer severity of the harm they caused.But the playbook they used, even if it isn't being used to the same devastating effect, is still alive and well today.MD0)Modern-day tyrants still rule North Korea [, Kim dynasty](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/apr/30/history-north-koreas-kim-dynasty/) , Putin's 19-year tenure as president of Russia (achieved by exploiting loopholes and even [rewriting the constitution](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/explained-russias-putin-signs-law-to-stay-in-power-until-2036-whats-the-change.html) ), and Trump's desperate attempt to reverse the 2020 election"Politicians and diapers must be changed often," Mark Twain's immortal words.And for the same reason:0
