In other words, they don't want to be there.Then we know the rumors of martial law (I believe it will come) were tamped down by Vladimir Putin 

.Demonstrations continue throughout the federation.It's not limited to the more cosmopolitan areas of the federation, such as Moscow and St Petersburg.It's also in places like [Kazakhstan](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/939347-kazakhstan-permits-pro-ukraine-rally) 

.MD0) This is a client state of the Russian Federation, not like Chechnya.They may be attempting to avoid sanctions, but it is still very significant.It means there is internal dissatisfaction.There's more information here.A large portion of the national guard, the Rosgvardya, has been sent to Ukraine.Many have been killed or injured, according to MD0.Some people are in captivity at this time.I will not post any video or audio of them speaking to the media because it is in breach of the Geneva Convention.In time, those testimonies should be added to war crimes and the history of the conflict.I cannot express myself in any conscience as a former Red Cross medicHowever, they seem to confirm a common tale we've heard.They didn't know they were sent to warThey don't want to be there.They owe their government to their government.We also know a lot of the troops were conscripts, who were coerced to sign contracts.This is how Putin's assertion that only contract soldiers are on the front lines can defy the truth.He is correct on technical terms.He is not telling people how these conscripts were coerced to do this.The supply chains are so bad that a forty-mile convoy appears to be stuck, perhaps abandoned.This is not helping. 

 This is not helping.If you are a Russian military planner, you know this is a disaster.MD0) If you're wondering how the oligarchs acquired all the yachts, planes, and houses in other countries, here's why.MD0) The truth is that deep graft led to the formation of a Potemkin army, according to the Potemkin army.We have initial reports of strikes in the Russian Federation.These are impossible to quantify, so use the right amount of salt you need and mainly skepticism.However, some of this may be happening right now.The middle class is also starting to feel this way.The buckwheat and sugar fermentation is startingWhen you first start to see buckwheat rationed, that's a bad sign.Butchers haven't lost a lot of purchasing power with salaries that were low to begin with, which is unfortunate.The caskets are starting to arrive home.This will add to the growing outrage since I know no one of the elite is in uniform or near any front line.This is when we see the possibility of another revolution and the Russian Federation's further balkanization.At the end of the first world war, we saw a military that was poorly prepared and led.The troopers mutinied, and we have proof that this has already happened.The army that came back from Afghanistan went to a world where the Taliban was crumbling.This is how the Baltic States and Ukraine came to be independent.The USSR could not afford to keep the lights on or the buckwheat on the shelves, as shown by the following diagram.For that matter, the sugar is the same as well.The Russian economy is stumbling.We know that the oligarchs are having a bad day because luxury products are no longer available in the country.But regular people are getting it.What is Putin doing? 

 What is Putin doing?He has shut the country down and jailed the criminalized despite calling this war a war.This could be the start of a second Russian revolution.The dynamic is in play.Of course, no revolution starts from nothing.The 1917 Revolution was also a result of 1905's disastrous Russo-Japanese war.Pressure cookers tend to move faster these days.Russia is one right now.This is a screenshot of the tension between [Radio Free Europe](https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-soldiers-ukraine-cannon-fodder-governor/31739187.html), which is an example of this tension:The governor of Maryland answered in University.This is in the Far East.In Rural SiberiaThese were cops, not soldiers.MD0) The fact that whole towns are burying their bodies means that Russia is unable to deny that this tragedy exists.The future of the Russian Federation is much less developed than the previous one.This is Putin's legacy.As it currently exists, it is uncertain if the country will survives or not, as it currently exists.
