MM0: Both grandmothers in their mid- to late 80s escaped Ukraine this weekend, a feat we did not expect to achieve this weekend, not only because of their age but also because of the rapidly deteriorating conflict.MD0) They awakened their Odessa apartment at 6 a.m. and travelled by bus, foot, and ferry all day until finally arriving in Bulgaria at 4 a.m., where they spent the night before the next leg of their journey.We received reports that the route they took was blocked the next day due to fighting and bombing in the area.(1) â€” Conditions change quickly.The most up-to-date information is found on social media.We joined several Facebook and Telegram groups [1](https://t.me/pomojiukr)), where we were able to locate evacuation buses, drivers, and [wait times for border crossings](https://t.me/OdessaMoldovaExpress) .

This was extremely helpful not only for our peace of mind, but also to help estimate arrival times at borders or at the final destination.Click [here](https://www.theverge.com/22676312/ios-iphone-apple-location-tracking-turn-off-on) for instructions on how to enable this function.(6) **Conserve cell phone capability.** If you're traveling in a group, take turns with your phones on.Turn off wifi and bluetooth, or set the phone to airplane mode.Bring an external battery pack and make sure you have the right cords for your machine.Yes, my grandmother brought her battery pack, but forgot the cord.Fortunately, a volunteer at the border was able to give her a spare, and her travel companion shared the most important details using her phone in the meantime).(7) (7) Keep the faith. 

 (7) Keep the faith.Despite a long, tiring journey, my grandparents made the first leg of the journey in good spirits.I'm in awe at their courage and tenacity.My grandmother, a survivor of WWII and now the War in Ukraine, told me on her arrival in Bulgaria.MD0)Stay strong, stay safe.
