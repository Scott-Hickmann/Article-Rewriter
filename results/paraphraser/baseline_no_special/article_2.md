"In summary, we have here [in the Soviet Union] that we have a political party committed adamantly to the belief that there is no permanent  *modus vivendi*, that our internal stability is weakened, our traditional way of life is shattered, and the international authority of our state must be broken if Soviet power is to be secure,” American diplomat George Kennan wrote these words in "The Long Telegram" What followed was a war of more than 40 years between the two world's two major powers. MD0) The two empires were unable to confront each other directly because of ever expanding nuclear arsenals. Instead, their ideological rivalry devolved into clandestine strikes, economic grabs, and open warfare that engulfed every corner of the globe. MD0) 0  When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the US emerged with an unquestioned military and political hegemony over the entire globe. The American ideological system had swung to the distance where the USSR's failed. Now a new war of a similar vein has started, and it is likely that future history books will show that world wars in the nuclear age were all cold wars. Despite this, the Second Cold War has started. MD0) The Russian invasion of Ukraine has ignited long-running tensions and divisions, much like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Nazi invasion of Poland. MD0) 0: Although Russia is now a rival of the US and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) led bloc, this time they are still the [junior partner](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/07/25/how-vladimir-putins-embrace-of-china-weakens-russia) of the influential and ascendant People's Republic of China's  emperor. This cold war has yet another defining feature, its ideological division. In place of the duel between capitalist and communist economic structures, there is a political divide between democratic and authoritarian regimes. This Second Cold War will either be the death of liberal democracy or the biggest triumph since World War II. MD0) Overly simplistic reports will show that this new cold war can be imagined within a similar framework to the old one for two reasons. First, it will be said that China is yet another communist power battling the capitalist world. This is inaccurate, pure economic communism in the world is long dead. MD0): For the lack of a better term, the Chinese government has moved away from traditional communism and towards a unique blend that can be described as [authoritarian capitalism](https://theconversation.com/how-china-combined-authoritarianism-with-capitalism-to-create-a-new-communism-167586) . While state control abounds, strict central economic planning and collection does not exist. Composition and creativity are both encouraged within the state's boundaries. Meanwhile, socialist theories, and policies have all reached varying degrees of acceptability and implementation around the globe. Some may have argued that the First Cold War was still a contest between democracy and authoritarianism, as shown by some. This argument simply does not stand up to historical scrutiny. Although both of the key combatants, particularly the United States, said to be fighting democracy's cause, it was never more than a secondary issue. The developing world was rife with failed and or authoritarian regimes that were propped up or funded by the US because of those regimes' commitment to anti-communism. MD0) Mmeanwhile  While authoritarianism closely followed Soviet Communism, the USSR was always committed to the expansion of the communist system and showed no affection for authoritarian states that remained outside of their ideological boundaries. MD0) Now that the Second Cold War is underway, it is clear that left right political ideologies are increasingly irrelevant for understanding what's going on. China and Russia are geographically distinct, and can be characterized as distant on the political spectrum. MD0) But what unites them is their ability to characterize authoritarian regimes as both morally and politically aspirant. This Chinese-Russian-centered Authoritarian Bloc is ranked among the most diverse blocs of states that includes Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela. The other hand hereafter, which is based on the United States and its NATO allies, reflects a similarly diverse ideological group. This plurality is even greater when considering the addition of Democracy Bloc states of the European Union, Latin American allies like Mexico, and Asian allies like India, Japan, and South Korea. The Democracy Bloc does not have any comrades like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which are in breach of the bloc's values. As the new cold war progresses, these countries are likely to be caught in the middle. Ultimately, ideology matters for little. MD0)What matters in this latest cold war is the organizing political principle of a country's government, whether it be political and free and fair elections or authoritarian with arbitrary executive power. MD0) This new cold war can be characterized as a full swing as a result of Russia's takeover of Ukraine, but the areas of conflict are also present around the globe and have been active for some time. Perhaps the next hottest location can be said to be [Taiwan](https://www.economist.com/china/2021/10/09/china-is-ratcheting-up-military-pressure-on-taiwan) For some time now, the Chinese military has been planning for a future invasion of Taiwan, even as the US and its allies have  [strategized](https://www.ft.com/content/54b0db59-a403-493e-b715-7b63c9c39093)  for its defense. China has many strategic and economic reasons for the conquest of Taiwan, but perhaps the most important motivation is symbolic. Tawaiwan is the last holdover of a non-communist China and has always enjoyed the US's vague support. Tawaiwan's ferocious independence in a region that China deems to be its own. Conquest of Taiwan will reveal that China is an equal of the United States that cannot be cowed or threatened. It will be the death knell of long-distance American global dominance. Taiwan is therefore vital to the current cold war because it could result in direct combat between the main combatants. Taiwan is part of a Second Cold War showdown that is mirrored in events in [Hong Kong](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/03/20/china-is-not-just-shackling-hong-kong-it-is-remaking-it) and the South China Sea. Since the United Kingdom returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, the city has been a semblance of democracy and civil liberties in a desert of authoritarianism. MD0:  0: Starting in 2019, Beijing placed stringent limits on the city and brutally repressed democracy campaigners in protest against western leaders' meaningless verbal objections. China also employed one of its most effective tools, gatekeeping of access to its vast internal market, to [intimidate](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/15/hong-kong-protestors-burn-lebron-james-jerseys-nba) and silence western critics of its repression. MD0)Meanwhile, China has attempted to reclaim control of the contested South China Sea by constructing islands and military facilities and threatening those that pass through. This has direct ramifications for several countries in the region, including Taiwan. The United States has continued to be present in the sea and contest Chinese claims. : Newest  [members of the Democracy Bloc have been deployed in combating the South China Sea for the first time.](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Indo-Pacific/Europe-pushes-back-against-Beijing-with-shows-of-Indo-Pacific-muscle) MD0) 0  0

MD0) This is a step to extend the Democracy Bloc's hand against China, and it has sparked many Chinese rebukes and protests. The range of hot or hard power conflicts extends beyond the military to economics and clandestine activities, as they did during the First Cold War. MD0): The United States started a possibly overdue  [trade war with China in 2018 due to the numerous Chinese misdeeds of the economic relationship between the two countries.](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/01/01/new-research-counts-the-costs-of-the-sino-american-trade-war) As the competition heats, US companies have begun a slow shift away from China. Both [Both](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/02/19/china-wants-to-insulate-itself-against-western-sanctions)  and [Russia](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/04/23/the-kremlin-has-isolated-russias-economy) have also begun to develop "fortress economies" or economic frameworks that are significantly less dependent on the west and therefore less vulnerable to sanctions and economic pressures imposed by the global economic system, which has been crafted in large part by US leadership. In the near future, it is likely that globalization will be reversed as economic ties match more closely than the Second Cold War's political divisions. MD0)  [China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/theres-chinese-interference-on-both-sides-of-the-2020-election/2020/10/29/49f90dfe-1a2c-11eb-82db-60b15c874105_story.html) and to a great extent  [have launched coordinated efforts of disinformation campaigns and election meddling with the explicit intention of destabilizing democratic nations.](https://www.csis.org/blogs/technology-policy-blog/russia-ramps-global-elections-interference-lessons-united-states) MD0) Although the most notable case was the support of the Trump campaign by Russian actions in 2016, the authoritarian Bloc's election interference has swept the globe, affecting Europe, Latin America, and Asia. It's less about picking winners and more about inducing instability and sowing divisions among democratic countries' populations. If leading democratic countries can be examples of democratic institutions' unreliability, the better for the Authoritarian Bloc. MD0)Still, the most significant and alarming part of the current cold war, is the unfolding  [of Ukraine, the country's biggest European war since World War II.](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/24/russia-invades-ukraine) What had been a thriving global competition was pushed out into the open by a rash Russian move. As the day of authoritarianism dawned, Vladimir Putin seems to have believed his own story, which was beset by division and inefficiency. In reality, he has shown that the Democracy Bloc, at least for the time, will be equal to the task. The left, right, and center of the United States, France, and Germany have all worked together to admonish Russia and back Ukraine, as well as punish Russian aggression. MD0): Putin has made his country an [unequil enemy](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/02/19/whether-he-invades-ukraine-or-backs-down-putin-has-harmed-russia?itm_source=parsely-api) of the majority of Europe and a uniting power for the Democracy Bloc in his attempts to restore a Russian Empire. Democracy Bloc sanctions[, particularly the German decision to suspend a critical Russian gas pipeline, have drawn a definitive boundary between the two countries and have exacerbated their economic division.](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/22/the-west-imposes-swift-sanctions-on-russia-can-they-stop-a-war) The stage is set, and the participants are in place, and the Second Cold War has begun. Although military conflicts will grab a lot of attention, the battlefield of persuasion is perhaps the most significant in this new cold war. MD0) As the two sides continue to convince the rest of the world that their model is the path to success, this will largely play out in the developing world. The Democracy Bloc is determined to show that liberal democracy survived in the First Cold War for a reason, although authoritarians maintain that only those at the top are supported by the current model, and that authoritarianism emanating from Beijing and Moscow is the path to prosperity. As global democracy has hit [alarming lows, the effects of this tug-of-war are already apparent, as shown by the following:](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/02/09/a-new-low-for-global-democracy) MD0) China has been expanding its overseas investment, mainly via  [the Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative), into the developing world for almost a decade. China has successfully made itself a profitable [component) in](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/02/06/china-wants-to-put-itself-back-at-the-centre-of-the-world)  Africa[, Asia, and](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/how-chinese-firms-have-dominated-african-infrastructure/21807721) Latin America[, becoming a](https://time.com/5936037/us-china-latin-america-influence/)  key trading partner [.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/biggest-trade-partner-of-each-country-1960-2020/) MD0) As of 2020, China has surpassed the US as the world's biggest trading partner. MD0) This is the area where the Trump administration's disastrous "America first" foreign policy has caused the most damage. At the same time as the US pulled and refused to provide any alternative, China has set about making itself a key component of the world's growth and infrastructure building. MD0) Now a fierce global leadership contest will break out with several countries that have long links to Beijing, with the US having strong links to Beijing. China has kept no information about its plans on global leadership The world just saw a glimpse of these aspirations in Beijing's 2022 Winter Olympics. 0 

 0: The comparison between the 2008 Olympics and China's display of power with its softer side in 2022 and the slogan "Together for a Shared Future" in an attempt to draw attention to the Chinese leadership's concentration camps and human rights abuses in the host country drew criticism. China is trying to convince countries in the balance between the blocs that they are the right model for the future. MD0) The country doubled down on its winter sports efforts, winning nine gold medals and thrashes the United States on the medal table. The face of these Olympic games is the most notable, and China made celebrity [Eileen Gu](https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/02/03/cold-warrior-why-eileen-gu-ditched-team-usa-to-ski-for-china) Born in California, but Gu made the most popular symbol in China. MM0:  Despite western reports of Chinese atrocities, here is an Olympic gold medalist born in the United States who would rather be Chinese. It is a choice that China hopes that many countries will make in the future. 0: 

 0: Just as the invasion of Ukraine has solidified the new cold war's dynamics in a military sense, the [Summit for Democracy](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/08/politics/china-russia-biden-us-democracy-summit/index.html), which was hosted by the US last December, did the same on the soft power front. The summit brought together more than 100 countries, not including China or Russia, to debate the democratic model's superiority and ways in which democracies can develop themselves. Chinese and Russian leadership  [vehemently condemned](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/08/politics/china-russia-biden-us-democracy-summit/index.html) the summit and went so far as to host their own International Forum on Democracy. They insisted that their countries had constituted democracies rather than better ones. Over 100 countries have been invited again this year Although China and Russia may attempt to coerce the language of democracy when necessary, it is safe to say that authoritarianism will always be the guiding principle. As Russian tanks roll through Ukraine and China's global leadership continues, there can be no doubt that a new global cold war has emerged. This time, the dividing line can be drawn between democratic and authoritarian political parties. As George Kennan discovered at the start of the First Cold War, this is a zero sum game. One side only succeeds where the other does not succeed. The world order established by each side can only exist if the other side's does not exist. Long-term peaceful coexistence is clearly not possible. Who will win?  Who will win? 

 Who will win? Predicting the victors of a global conflict is a fool's errand. MD0) Both sides should have faith that their team will win, but if history is any indication, both sides will win to some degree. What is certain is that liberal democracy, which includes human rights and widespread participation in government, is a cause worth fighting and dying for.
