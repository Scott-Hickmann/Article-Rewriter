As a result, people are forced into distorted characterizations by the media, who roundly criticize these depictions. Furthermore, when people trying to learn about NFTs ask basic questions to those “in the know,” these questions are shot down as being “dumb”.(MD0)"

NFTs are pieces of the internet that can actually be owned. They exist permanently in a virtual record book that can never be changed, only added-onto. This technology allows NFTs to behave kind of like collectibles, such as baseball cards, with a verified owner.(MD0)(MD0)(MD1)2. Who cares who owns the image if anyone can just look at it?(MD1)(MD0)"

These collections have a finite number of NFTs in them and some collections have become quite famous and desirable— often for different reasons. For example, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection is now a recognized brand that celebrities and businesses buy into every week. In contrast, the CryptoPunks collection is recognized as the first NFT collection ever created. Owning a Punk is like owning a piece of technological history. As a collection becomes more valued, so does each constituent NFT.(MD0)"

In fact, believe it or not, the essence of an NFT collection is actually “community”. The idea of a community of owners is built-in to the very concept of every NFT collection. The most basic example of this is the proliferation of private online chat rooms open only to individuals that can verify that they own a piece of a particular NFT collection. This aspect of value is very difficult to articulate to those who have never been a part of an NFT community. Even upon reflection, all I can say is that NFTs are uncannily effective at organizing communities of like-minded individuals both virtually and in-person — To truly comprehend what this means, I suggest jumping into one such community yourself!(MD0)"

NFTs these days have moved beyond the artwork attached to them (which, I admit, is often terrible) to encompass a wide variety of different uses, or “utilities”. Some NFTs allow you to be a part-owner in a real-world asset, such as a business. Others allow you to directly support your favorite musical artists, who then share their profits with the owners of their NFTs. Simply put, NFTs are redefining ownership of both virtual and physical assets.(MD0)"

NFTs are simply an evolution of what many perceive to be valuable.,"NFTs are simply an evolution of what many perceive to be valuable, says author.",NFTs are simply an evolution of what many perceive to be valuable.,"(MD0)Fads become popular suddenly but usually do not stay popular for very long. NFTs certainly share some characteristics of fads! For example, NFT value is rather subjective and NFTs have dramatically risen in popularity in the last year. But although the value of NFTs is completely determined by the community, this isn’t as alarming as it seems. While it may be difficult to understand at first why people value intangible assets like NFTs, let’s back up a bit and discuss value in general. Why do people value Teslas or Rolexes or that Saint Laurent leather jacket? What about abstract art? At one point in time, I guarantee you many questioned the value of items tied to such intangible worth. They don’t anymore. NFTs, I argue, are simply an evolution of what many perceive to be valuable.(MD0)"

Recently, NFT owners have attempted to buy entire sports teams (or even the Constitution of the United States!). Others are using NFTs for political organization. Still others are using NFTs for the next wave of “play to earn” video games. As someone who has been in the NFT space for a while, I am still constantly being shocked by the potential of what an NFT can be. In fact, I’ve become convinced that the term “NFT” is already vastly outdated — “NFTs” are no longer a single concept but an increasingly heterogeneous group of utilities. We’ve only begun to scratch the surface of how to use this exciting technology. And the people I know working on it are nothing short of extraordinary.(MD0)"
