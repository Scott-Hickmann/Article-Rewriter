Mother had just been separated from her children as they were evacuated out of the city.

Germans have spent 80 years apologising for what their predecessors did. Putin is cursing Russians with that same burden.

My father was evacuated to America and didn't really know his father until he was seven. That deep hatred lasts for generations, not years.

Putin is lost in his own false propaganda and twisted version of history, says author.

Everything Russian is being boycotted — the Russian economy is now toxic. Russia, as a brand, is now so poisonous that no business can afford any connection with it.

Putin has quickly made Russia hated around the world. From UN votes, to Social Media, to boycotts, Russia has very, very few friends.

Germany was openly hated and mocked. What we would now consider racist jokes about Germans were completely acceptable.

By the time I was in my late 30s I had German friends, and grew very fond of the country and people. By then my grandparents’ generation had mostly died.

Germany is a new country, with new generations of people, and both have set an impressive example.

The full gravity of what his grandparents' generation had done had just started to sink in.

This was far from being the first time I had seen a young German struggle with their history. It is tough, unfair, and a betrayal of them by previous generations. It is also a personal and collective process that has contributed to what makes Germany such a great nation now.

Russians will start to experience hatred, racism, aggression, sideways glances, animosity. They may be the best and kindest people, they may be anti-Putin activists, but they are now under the shadow of his crimes.

By the end of this war, many of us in the West will have seen streets in Ukraine that we have walked down bombed to rubble.

Russia's leader and army have been arrested for protesting against the war.

Putin has re-written Russian history from a failed dictatorship into an aggressor that brought death and destruction to Europe.

Putin sent a huge army into a peaceful country and killed women, children, and fellow Slavs for no reason beyond hubris and ego.

The damage Putin has done to Russia is greater than all the harm he has done over the last few decades. The veils of civility have fallen, the lustre of Russian money is tarnished. The party is over for the oligarchs, and the West will now start to shift away from tolerating both Russian aggression and Russian money

Ukraine will never forgive Russia for its crimes against Ukraine over the last century. For the rest of the world, Russia will spend a generation or more rebuilding its image.

Hitler set out to build a greater Germany, and ended up destroying everywhere else including Germany. Putin is destroying Ukraine, and he is also destroying Russia.
