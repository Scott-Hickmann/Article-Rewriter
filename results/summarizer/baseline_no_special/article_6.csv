"Putin is lost in his own false propaganda and twisted version of history, says author.","Ukraine is not a far-away place with which we have no emotional ties, says author. Westerners have been there for holidays, and Ukrainians live and work in towns and cities across Europe and America.","Putin is lost in his own false propaganda and twisted version of history, says author.","(MD0)Putin is lost in his own false propaganda and twisted version of history. He does not really live in the 21st Century so he didn’t realise Ukraine has been open to the world ever since it kicked out his last puppet dictator. Westerners have been there for holidays, and Ukrainians live and work in towns and cities across Europe and America. Ukraine is not a far-away place with which we have no emotional ties (as may be, to our shame, the case with Chechnya and Syria). Many of us in the West are watching the shelling of cities we’ve visited and seeing people we know share videos and photos on our social media feeds of their homes and families under attack. Soon, I fear, we will start to hear reports of people we know being killed by Russian soldiers and bombs.(MD0)"
"Everything Russian is being boycotted — the Russian economy is now toxic. Russia, as a brand, is now so poisonous that no business can afford any connection with it.",This is a European war.

Russia, as a brand, is now so poisonous that no business can afford any connection with it.","(MD0)This is a European war. Putin failed to understand that Ukraine is already Europe. He is far too late to prevent that. The reaction has been fast. Everyone is siding with Ukraine. Everything Russian is being boycotted — the Russian economy is now toxic. Russia, as a brand, is now so poisonous that no business can afford any connection with it. Everything is being withdrawn from Russia. Putin’s Russia is becoming North Korea, not the great Imperial Russia of its past. Like so many Tsars and dictators before him, Putin has become so isolated in his high castle that he has completely lost touch with the present.(MD0)"

Germany was openly hated and mocked.

What we would now consider racist jokes about Germans were completely acceptable.,"(MD0)To give it some context, and as an insight for those younger than me, when I was growing up in the 1970s and 1980s plenty of the older generation around me refused to buy German or Japanese products. Germany was openly hated and mocked. What we would now consider racist jokes about Germans were completely acceptable. This was because — like today’s Ukrainians — the people I grew up around had been bombed by Germans, fought against Germans, known people who were killed by the Germans. I grew up around war veterans, Holocaust survivors, women who had been mothers during the Blitz, just like Ukrainian mothers now in Kharkiv.(MD0)"

By the time I was in my late 30s I had German friends, and grew very fond of the country and people, but by then my grandparents’ generation had mostly died. Whilst they were alive, and I was younger, I would have received harsh comments and surprised looks if I had gone to Germany or had German friends, let alone bought a German car.(MD0)"

I now live in a Europe where it would be inappropriate and irrational to hate Germans or Germany because of what happened in the war. We haven’t moved on or forgotten those crimes, but Germany is a new country, with new generations of people, and both have set an impressive example when it comes to owning and building positively on their history.(MD0)"

Kreuzberg was bustling, as ever. We saw a teenage boy sitting in a doorway weeping. Concerned, we went over to ask if he was ok. He was a little drunk and very emotional. With tears in his eyes he told us he had just been studying what his country had done in the war. As he was entering adulthood and his perspective and sense of self was developing, the full gravity of what his grandparents’ generation had done, or had failed to prevent, had just started to sink in. He was owning it all, feeling the full weight of history press down on him, he was genuinely distraught, overflowing with guilt, anguish, and shame.(MD0)"

"This was far from being the first time I had seen a young German struggle with their history. It is tough, unfair, and a betrayal of them by previous generations.

A Russian couple were sitting opposite me chatting in Russian. I felt myself looking up at them, I noticed other people looking at them.

They may be the best and kindest people, they may be anti-Putin activists, they may themselves be amongst the many refugees from his dictatorship, but they are now under the shadow of his crimes, because crimes against humanity illicit a response from humanity.(MD0)"

I pity them just as I found myself pitying young Germans. It is not a rational response, but it is inevitable.
