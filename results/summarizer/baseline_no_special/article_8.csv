They left their Odessa apartment at 6 AM to the sounds of air raid sirens and traveled by bus, foot, and ferry all day until finally reaching their accommodations in Bulgaria at 4 AM, where they spent the night before the next leg of their journey. We heard reports that the route they took was closed the very next day due to fighting and bombing in the area.(MD0)"

It is unspeakably cruel, forcing families to make the unimaginable choice between staying together or fleeing to safety. As a result, women and children must cross the border alone. This journey was especially risky for my elderly grandmothers. We were grateful to find another woman via Facebook who was anxious to travel and agreed to form a small group. They met for the first time the day before their trip and spent the night together in my grandmother’s apartment. Over the next 24 hours, they helped each other by carrying bags, exchanging cell phone battery packs, and sharing information. I came to think of my grandmothers’ companion as their Guardian Angel. It broke my heart that Guardian Angel had to leave her 25 year old son behind in Ukraine.(MD0)"
