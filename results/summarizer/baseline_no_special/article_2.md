When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States emerged with an unquestioned military and political hegemony over the entire globe. The American ideological system had gone the distance where that of the USSR had failed.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has ignited a touchpaper that merely crystalized long simmering tensions and divisions. This cold war has another fundamental distinguishing factor, its ideological divide.

Since the 1970s the Chinese government has transitioned away from traditional communism and embraced a unique amalgam that can be described as [authoritarian capitalism.](https://theconversation.com/how-china-combined-authoritarianism-with-capitalism-to-create-a-new-communism-167586)

Some may stipulate that the First Cold War was already a competition between democracy and authoritarianism.

China and Russia are ideologically distinct and can be classified as distant on the political spectrum. But their desire to define authoritarian regimes as morally acceptable and politically superior is what unites them.

The Democracy Bloc based on the United States and its NATO allies reflects a similarly diverse ideological group.

Taiwan is the last holdover of a non-communist China. Taiwan’s continued independence is an acknowledgement of US hegemony in a territory China considers to be its own.

Taiwan is part of a Second Cold War showdown that is mirrored in events in Hong Kong and South China Sea. Since the United Kingdom returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 the city had served as an oasis of democracy and civil liberties in a desert of authoritarianism.

US companies have begun a slow shift away from China as the rivalry deepens.](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/01/01/new-research-counts-the-costs-of-the-sino-american-trade-war)

Russia has launched concerted efforts to destabilize democratic countries. The election interference of the Authoritarian Bloc spans the globe.

Vladimir Putin seems to have believed his own side's narrative that the democracies would fall by the wayside as the day of authoritarianism dawned.

The Democracy Bloc is determined to prove that liberal democracy prevailed in the First Cold War.

As of 2020, China has surpassed the United States as the world's biggest trading partner. This is the area where the disastrous “America first’s foreign policy of the Trump administration has done its most damage.

Oft commented on the contrast between the 2008 Olympics and China’s display of power with its softer side in 2022. China wants to convince countries in the balance between the blocs that they are the best model for the future.

The summit brought together over 100 countries, not including China or Russia, to discuss the superiority of the democratic model.

As George Kennan realized at the beginning of the First Cold War, this is a zero sum game. The world order advanced by each side can only exist if the other side's does not.
