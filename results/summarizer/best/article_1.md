This morning I woke up to the hopeful news that some Russian forces are [pulling back from the border](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60392259) with Ukraine. This isn't quite the positive sign it might appear.

[like Anne Applebaum pretend this means Russians are always lying, but this isn't at all the case. Maskirovka is about keeping an opponent guessing about your true intentions, and nothing else is just fluff designed to muddy waters.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/lavrov-russia-diplomacy-ukraine/622075/)

Putin wants Ukraine to become a Russian client state like it used to be, as Belarus is today. This means eliminating the possibility of Ukraine ever joining NATO.

Ukraine is too corrupt and undemocratic to qualify for membership now, and NATO itself probably won't be around in ten years and its member states know it. In exchange European leaders get a ready-made excuse to let America do their dirty work while acting in public.

NATO allowed Hungary and Czechoslovakia to fall to Moscow when Joe Biden was young.

Putin uses their recent experience of being basically at the mercy of America and NATO in the 1990s and 2000s.

Americans want to pretend that autocrats like Putin aren't accountable to anyone, but this isn't strictly true. The Russian people could revolt against their oppressive government, but few ever will so long as the economy is okay.

Ukraine continues to insist [Crimea and Donbas belong to it](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210823-ukraine-opens-international-summit-calling-for-return-of-crimea-from-russia). A future nightmare scenario haunts Moscow's dreams, a scenario where Ukraine joins NATO then tries to reclaim these territories.

Putin is clearly determined to end the unstable situation along the Russia-Ukraine border one way or another. He is probably bluffing about surrounding Kyiv, the threat of it happening can't be ignored.

Major Russian forces [historically deployed in Siberia have been moved to the western military districts. It is no accident that they are arrayed in a position to swiftly invade and from the border.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/15/heres-what-we-know-about-russias-military-buildup-near-ukraine/)

Putin is sending every credible signal possible that he's willing to go down this road if he feels he must and he might if his objectives cannot be achieved any other way.

American leaders are obsessed with the concept of [deterrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory), a technique I became quite familiar with earning a pair of pair of policy focused masters degrees in grad school.

Americans absolutely *lurve* cost-benefit analysis because it looks more concrete than it truly is. CBA is used in policy mostly to justify an action some politician wants to take and needs cover for.

Sanctions are a means of looking tough to a domestic audience and little more. This is why America's sanctions obsession is so vapid and toothless.

Under Biden has refused to see sense and work out a long-term stable pact, China has no reason to restrain Putin.

Public proclamations of NATO unity [are covering up deep cracks between Germany and France.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/world/europe/nato-russia-ukraine-europe.html)

The threat of conflict means airlines are stopping service. Investment in Ukraine is going to be a massive risk going forward.

Putin doesn't have to decide on a date to invade Ukraine — he can simply park his forces where they are as a permanent, existential threat. The idea that Russia will attack Ukraine over time with constant aggressive maneuvers Kyiv can't ignore than a massive invasion.

Putin has been aggressively working on a maskirovka campaign specifically designed to gaslight American and allied intelligence. Politicians and pundits are latching onto every intelligence intercept.

Putin has been able to trap him in a dynamic where America looks like its crying chicken little every five minutes.

Putin pulling back some troops from the border ahead of the new German chancellor Scholz is a classic technique. It *looks* like he's keeping a diplomatic off ramp clear.

Russia insists Ukraine is plotting an offensive in Donbas that will harm Russian people.

Russia's military buildup has been slow and deliberate over the past year, punctuated with sudden movements under the guise of exercises. This is a long-term shift in Russia's positions intended to communicate that Russia trusts China.

I seriously doubt any conflict in Ukraine begins with a sudden massive Russian attack. What he needs to justify an attack is an outburst of violence like what appears to be now escalating in Donbas.

If an attack comes, everyone will believe what they want to.

Both American and Russian sources hinted at the other side launching some kind of chemical weapons attack, which is classic in false-flag operations.

No one will be sure who actually did it for some time. It took months of direct inspections to prove [Syria used chemical weapons in Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_chemical_weapons_in_the_Syrian_civil_war).

People on both sides will believe what their leaders and media insist is true. Just like Americans are fighting with each other over what actually happened in the Capitol Attack.

The Ukraine crisis ends. Ukraine to choose between unfair negotiations that force cession of Donbas and Crimea permanently or a huge war.

Germany's hope is that it will prevent Ukraine from joining NATO through setting clear conditions on membership Kyiv is unlikely to be able to meet for twenty years. An effective demilitarized zone buffering the two sides along their mutual borders are sadly going to be necessary to avert a war.

Putin's objectives in this crisis ranked according to importance are:

Neutralize the threat of Ukraine joining NATO joining NATO anytime soon2. Maintain control over the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbas
Weaken NATO over the long run by proving its limitations4. Pull Ukraine into Russia's orbit permanently.

Biden is backing down as fast as he can while trying to refocus America's attention on China.

Putin aims to resolve 1 and 2. He would clearly prefer to win through negotiation, but it is apparent that he is committed to victory even at serious cost to Russia's international reputation and long-term relationship with Ukraine.

If an insurgency doesn't kill hundreds of Russian soldiers, eventually Ukraine will be free again.

Putin is more cautious than people give him credit for and Russia's newly-professional military is as casualty averse and reliant on firepower as America's — moving in after a collapse of the Kyiv government is a distinct possibility.

A limited operation opens the door to further conquest through non-military means. Having to do this would represent a partial failure of his own strategy.

The Transatlantic Alliance will always be hindered by [America's ongoing collapse.](https://medium.com/gen/fourth-america-is-almost-over-americans-want-a-divorce-9367a5d50df7)

Biden entirely concerned about his domestic audience and pitiful chances at re-election in 2024. A classic politician who cares only for his own interests, Biden cannot be trusted and is as much an accelerator of America's demise.

Putin's maskirovka is designed to obscure his core aims, but Putin is savvy enough to realize he doesn't get it if there's an all-out war.

Russia can simply sit back and bombard Ukraine's armed forces in the east because in all warfare the core requirement is to defeat you enemy's military, not capture their cities.

Putin gives Zelensky an ultimatum, threatening a total invasion if he doesn't accede to Russian demands. If Ukraine negotiates, the attacks stop.

It's on America to go ahead with its sanctions threat. Russia insists it's not invading anyone, just supporting people under attack. The major attack could involve chemical weapons in order to directly call into question American assertions of Russian responsibility.

If major fighting begins, it continues until Zelensky agrees to terms or falls to a coup after Ukraine's military is decimated. Russia's forces surrounding Ukraine give Putin give Putin options he can elect to deploy one at a time or all at once.

Putin learned Clausewitz's lesson better than anyone. But America's strategy has failed and is probably making everything worse.

In the long run, only Europe can ever defend Ukraine. Only Europe can deal with Russia.
