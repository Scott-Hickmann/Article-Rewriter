The American ideological system had gone the distance where our society is disrupted, our traditional way of life be destroyed, the international authority of our state be broken, if Soviet power is to be secure.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has ignited a touchpaper that merely crystalized long simmering tensions and divisions. This Second Cold War will either be the grave of liberal democracy or its greatest triumph since World War II.

Since the 1970's the Chinese government has transitioned away from traditional communism and embraced a unique amalgam.

The developing world was rife with corrupt and or authoritarian regimes that were propped up or supported by the United States.

The Second Cold War begins, it is apparent that left right political ideologies are increasingly meaningless for understanding what is happening. But their desire to define authoritarian regimes as morally acceptable and politically superior is what unites them.

The Democracy Bloc does also have some awkward allies like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, that violate the bloc's principles.

The Chinese military has made preparations for a future invasion of Taiwan even as the United States and its allies have [strategized](https://www.ft.com/content/54b0db59-a403-493e-b715-7b63c9c39093) for its defense. Taiwan's continued independence is an acknowledgement of US hegemony in a territory China considers to be its own.

The United States has continued to maintain a presence in the sea and contest Chinese claims. This has direct consequences for several countries in the region including Taiwan.

In 2018, the United States began a probably overdue [trade war with China over the many Chinese abuses of the economic relationship between the two countries.

The election interference of the Authoritarian Bloc spans the globe, impacting Europe, Latin America, and Asia. It is less about picking winners and more about creating creating instability and sowing divisions among the populations of democratic countries.

Putin seems to have believed his own side's narrative that beset by the wayside as the day of authoritarianism dawned. He has proven that the Democracy Bloc, at least for now, will be equal to the task.

The Democracy Bloc is determined to prove that liberal democracy prevailed in the First Cold War for a reason while the authoritarians insist that only those at the top are served by the current system.

A fierce competition for global leadership will playout with several countries formerly aligned with the United States. China has set about making itself a key part of the development and infrastructure building of countries across the world.

A [diplomatic boycott by several Democracy Bloc countries in attempt to draw attention to the concentration camps and human rights abuses of the host nation drew ire from the Chinese leadership.

The summit brought together over 100 countries, not including China or Russia, did the same on the soft power front. Chinese and Russian leadership [furiously denounced](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/08/politics/china-russia-biden-us-democracy-summit/index.html) the summit and went so far as to host their own International Forum on Democracy.

As Russian tanks roll across the Ukraine and Chinese advances in global leadership continue there can be no doubt that a new worldwide cold war has emerged. This time the dividing line can be found between democratic and authoritarian political regimes.
