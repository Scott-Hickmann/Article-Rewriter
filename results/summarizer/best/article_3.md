Nikita Khrushchev gave a speech called, [On The Cult Of Personality And its Consequences in which he roundly criticised Stalin's foundationally dishonest, authoritarian brand of leadership.](https://www.ht.lu.se/media/utbildning/dokument/kurser/EUHA14/20121/Nikita_S._Khrushchev__The_Secret_Speech_On_the_Cult_of_Personality_1956.pdf)

If I've watched the nightmare unfolding in Ukraine, I keep being dragged back to that question of reality.

The downright Orwellian attempts to frame Russia as [liberators instead of occupiers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/pure-orwell-how-russian-state-media-spins-ukraine-invasion-as-liberation). There's his portrayal of Luhansk and Donetsk as [plucky, newly-independent states.](https://youtu.be/jUkrigz3L0Q)

Putin tried to justify the impending economic sanctions to an assembly of oligarchs stood out:

We arrive at the only thing that truly terrifies leaders like these; the truth.

Russia [tightened news censorship](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/02/28/russia-war-censorship-reaches-new-heights) as news of the [scale of their losses began to roll in.

The easiest way to control a population is to control what they see and hear and think. With the Russian and Ukrainian people in such close contact, it would be all but impossible to maintain his hold over their reality.

The playbook they used, even if it's not being used to the same devastating effect, is alive and well today.

The immortal words of Mark Twain, “*Politicians and diapers must be changed often. And for the same reason*.

Putin's threats this weekend of [mutually assured destruction](https://youtu.be/RJXwLzII278). Putin's threats include the cult-like control they exert over their followers.

Leaders who try to control the reality of their people will eventually have to shed blood to maintain the illusion.
