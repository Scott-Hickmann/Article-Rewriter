The more cosmopolitan areas of the federation like Moscow and St Petersburg. It's also in places like [Kazakhstan](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/939347-kazakhstan-permits-pro-ukraine-rally).

This is a client state of the Russian Federation, not unlike Chechnya. It means there is internal dissent.

A lot of the national guard, the Rosgvardyia, have been deployed to Ukraine. I will not link to either video or audio of them speaking to the press, given it is a violation of the Geneva Convention.

Putin's words that only contract soldiers are on the front lines can skirt the reality. Putin is not telling people how these conscripts were forced to sign contracts. We also know a lot of the troops were conscripted, who were forcing to sign contract.

The supply chains are so broken that a forty-mile convoy seems stuck, perhaps abandoned. The reality is that deep corruption led to a Potemkin army.

We have initial reports of strikes within the Russian Federation. These are impossible to confirm, so use the proper amount of salt need, and chiefly skepticism.

The middle class is also starting to feel this. Rationing of buckwheat and sugar is starting to come home.

This is when we enter the prospect of another revolution and the further balkanization of the Russian Federation. We have evidence this already has happened.

The Russian economy is reeling, but regular people are feeling it. We know this perhaps the oligarchs are having a bad day since luxury goods are no longer in the market.

The 1917 revolution was also a consequence of the disastrous Russo-Japanese war of 1905. These days pressure cookers tend to move faster. Russia is one right now.

The governor answered in University. This is Putin's legacy, whether the country survives, or not, as it presently exists, is a good question.
