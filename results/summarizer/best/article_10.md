If those that know me, you know exactly how big of a basketball and LeBron James fan I am.

Basketball, to me, is an educational tool. The game has done so much for me growing up and I do my best to give back to the next generation.

Basketball is. Is. Art.

Last night, the Golden State Warriors visited the Los Angeles Lakers for a prime-time game on national television. The Lakers are led by an all-time talent and resume in LeBron James, who's put together a phenomenal performance in his 19th-season.

The most predictable outcome was the Warriors coming into the Lakers arena and beating them by 20 points, simply piling onto the misery of this season.

In year 19 — which, to be fair is more like year 22 if you account for all of the playoff games and mileage. The Lakers started the game hot before they fell down double-digits midway through the game.

The heated performance of James was in jeopardy. The next 9 minutes of basketball was straight out of a movie. The arena went wild as everyone was in awe of what they were witnessing.

Both teams went back and forth the entire quarter as both teams desperately needed a win. LeBron followed up a costly turnover with an alley-oop dunk so thunderous that I thought he was about to tear the rim down.

The REAL motherwifein’ hoopers show out.

The Lakers are still fighting for a playoff spot but everything feels real now. Give him a healthy-enough Anthony Davis and I'm giving them a fighter's chance.

The city found the glimmer of hope they needed for this season.

The ability to take such negative feelings, channel into your own ability, and deliver an all-time performance, is a sentiment that cannot be described with words; it's simply something you feel. Hold onto that feeling.
