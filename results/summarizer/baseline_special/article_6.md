Mother in Kyiv had just been separated from her children as they were evacuated out of the city.

Putin is cursing Russians with that same burden. Germans have spent 80 years apologising for what their predecessors did.

My grandfather liberated Belsen concentration camp and never really recovered from what he saw. That deep hatred lasts for generations, not years, says author.

Ukraine is not a far-away place with which we have no emotional ties. Westerners have been there for holidays, and Ukrainians live and work in towns and cities across Europe and America.

Putin failed to understand that Ukraine is already Europe, he is far too late to prevent that. Everything Russian is being boycotted — the Russian economy is now toxic.

Putin has quickly made Russia hated around the world. From UN votes, to Social Media boycotts, Russia has very, very few friends. For decades to come, their country will be like Germany after the last war.

Germany was openly hated and mocked. What we would now consider racist jokes about Germans were completely acceptable.

Germany is no coincidence that by the time I was in my late 30s I only visited Germany for the first time.

Once my grandparents’ generation had died, I now live in a Europe where we haven’t moved on or forgotten those crimes. But Germany is a new country, with new generations of people, and both have new generations.

The full gravity of what his grandparents’ generation had done had just started to sink in.

We sat with him for some time, talking, but we told him it was not his country's history. It was history, and he was part of the new Germany, a British Jew and a young German in a wonderfully diverse and open city, embracing.

Germany is a beacon for peace and freedom, says German journalist. It is tough, unfair, and a betrayal of them by previous generations, he says.

All Russians will start to experience hatred, racism, aggression, sideways glances, animosity. They may be the best and kindest people, they may be anti-Putin activists, but they are now under the shadow of his crimes.

By the end of this war, many of us in the West will have seen streets in Ukraine bombed to rubble, and will know friends, or friends of friends, who were killed by Russian bombs and soldiers. If the Russian army kills my friends, I will never forget that or forgive it. It will shape my whole relationship with

The war is not a rational response, but it is inevitable. It is unfair on all those thousands of Russians who have been arrested for protesting against this war.

Putin has re-written Russian history from a failed dictatorship into an aggressor that brought death and destruction to Europe. He will now be remembered for bombing civilians, destroying beautiful cities, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Like Hitler and Stalin, he will never be forgiven forever, says author. Putin sent a huge army into a peaceful country and killed women, children, and fellow Slavs.

The damage Putin has done to Russia is greater than all the harm he has done over the last few decades. The veils of civility have fallen, the lustre of Russian money is tarnished. The party is over for the oligarchs, and the West will now start to shift away from tolerating both Russian aggression and Russian money

Ukraine will never forgive Russia for its crimes against Ukraine over the last century. For the rest of the world, Russia will spend a generation or more rebuilding its image.

History has seen Hitler set out to build a greater Germany, and he is also destroying Russia. By the time Putin is finished, he will have scarred generations of hatred, pain, and grief into the collective memory of the Ukrainian people.
