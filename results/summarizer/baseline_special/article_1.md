Russian forces are pulling back from the border with Ukraine.

Russiaphobic bigots like Anne Applebaum pretend this means Russians are always lying, but this isn't true.

Putin wants Ukraine to become a Russian client state like Belarus is today. This means eliminating the possibility of Ukraine ever joining NATO.

Ukraine is too corrupt to qualify for NATO membership now, says John Sutter. NATO functions as a way of getting American taxpayers to fund defense spending European countries ought to be providing themselves.

NATO has always been a shaky alliance from thinking it could invade countries critical to American interests. NATO allowed Hungary and Czechoslovakia to fall to Moscow when Joe Biden was young.

Russian leaders like Putin don't look at the present and assume it will continue forever. They habitually plan ten years down the road, using their recent experience of being basically at the mercy of America and NATO in the 1990s and 2000s.

Americans are caught up in the fake war to protect democracy, but this isn't true. The Russian people could revolt against their oppressive government, but few ever will so long as the economy is okay.

Putin has an incentive to look into the future and estimate where Russia could be in a decade. Ukraine continues to insist Crimea and Donbas belong to it.

Putin is determined to end the unstable situation along the Russia-Ukraine border one way or another.

Major Russian military forces in Siberia have been moved to the western military districts.

Putin does not want to undertake a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. But he is sending every credible signal possible that he is willing to go down this road.

American leaders are obsessed with the concept of deterrence, making the critical error in failing to think from Putin’s perspective.

CBA is used in policy mostly to justify an action some politician wants to take. CBA is often used to justify a policy that is mostly used by policy.

Sanctions are a means of looking tough to a domestic audience and little more. Sanctions have already worked out a way around them.

Putin’s threat of being cut off from the global banking system is mitigated with Chinese support. Russia and China are now officially strong allies now.

NATO unity is covering up deep cracks between the main continental European participants, Germany and France.

Putin has now successfully successfully  successfully helped Russia in Ukraine. The threat of conflict means airlines are stopping service.

The idea that Russia will attack Ukraine out of nowhere is frankly silly, because he gains far more by exhausting Ukraine over time.

For the past month, Russian intelligence has been aggressively working on a maskirovka campaign specifically designed to gaslight American and allied intelligence. Politicians and pundits are latching onto every intelligence intercepts.

Putin has been able to trap him in a dynamic where America looks like its crying chicken little every five minutes.

Putin pulling back some troops from the border ahead of the new German chancellor Scholz is a classic technique.

Russia insists Ukraine is plotting an offensive in Donbas.

Russia's military buildup has been slow and deliberate over the past year. This is a long-term shift in Russia’s positions intended to communicate that Russia trusts China and potential conflicts in Europe and Asia will always be linked.

The bluff this could happen has been useful making London and Washington panic but doesn't match up with Putin's domestic rhetoric. What he needs to justify an attack is an outburst of violence like what appears to be now escalating in Donbas.

The problem with them doing this is that by definition false-flag operations are difficult to attribute with any certainty.

Both American and Russian sources hinted at the other side launching some kind of chemical weapons attack, which is classic in false-flag operations.

It took months of direct inspections to prove Syria used chemical weapons in Syria.

People on both sides will believe what their leaders and media insist is true.

A major blowup that triggers a Russian ultimatum to Zelensky will force Ukraine to choose between unfair negotiations that force cession of Donbas and Crimea. Biden has already ruled out in an idiotic, counterproductive self-own.

Ukraine is unlikely to be able to join NATO through setting clear conditions on membership. Autonomy for Crimea will remain Russian plus an effective demilitarized zone buffering the two sides along their mutual borders.

Putin has to keep ratcheting up pressure on Kyiv until he gets what he wants or Zelensky falls, writes Peter Bergen.

Weaken NATO over the long run by proving its limitations.

Putin has already achieved 3 and 4. Biden is backing down as fast as he can to refocus America’s attention on China.

Putin is committed to victory even at serious cost to Russia’s international reputation and long-term relationship with Ukraine.

The real deterrent to a major invasion is the fact that a big war will permanently sever whatever bonds remain. Even if an insurgency doesn't kill hundreds of Russian soldiers, eventually Ukraine will be free again.

Putin is more cautious than people give him credit for Russia’s military conquest is the least likely outcome.

Putin does not want to conquer Ukraine by force. A limited operation opens the door to further conquest through non-military means.

The Transatlantic Alliance will always be hindered by America's ongoing collapse. Russia can now actively intensify if it chooses, and might, as part of Putin's ultimate revenge for the fall of the Soviet Union.

Ukraine is running away just like it did in Afghanistan, Biden entirely concerned about his domestic audience.

Putin's maskirovka is designed to obscure his core aims, but Putin is savvy enough to realize he doesn't get it if there's an all-out war.

A direct invasion of Ukraine at any point will follow an initial campaign intended to crush Ukraine’s armed forces in the east.

Russia makes several moves that keep a door open to negotiations and imply a willingness to back down. An accident or intentional attack kills Russian soldiers or Russian-speakers in Ukraine. If Ukraine negotiates, the attacks stop.

The major attack could involve chemical weapons in order to directly call into question American assertions of Russian responsibility.

Russia's forces surrounding Ukraine give Putin options he can elect to deploy one at a time or all at once.

War is war is war, and politics is part of a deeper, deeper game, says John Sutter.

In the long run, only Europe will ever defend Ukraine. Only Europe can deal with Russia. American leaders are too ignorant of geography, history, and systems to be trusted in this crisis.
