I love watching to learn and understand the finer details of the game; this includes, but is not limited to, details like footwork, spacing, rotations, off-ball movement, and so on… one might say I’m a nerd when it comes to hoops.

The Warriors have been one of the league’s top teams all year despite a recent slide; I wish I could say the same for the Lakers. Despite having enough talent to hold a playoff spot, the Lakers have been abysmal; lack of continuity and chemistry among their roster is apparent and the team is clinging onto their playoff lives. The Lakers are led by an all-time talent and resume in LeBron James, who’s put together a phenomenal performance in his 19th-season. Still, at age 37, even he cannot will this Lakers team to win night after night. It’s a terrible reality for a fanbase that’s accustomed to championships — anything short of that is a failure of a season, especially when you’ve got LeBron James on your team. Even for the most optimistic fans, this Lakers season is as good as over.(MD0)"

The Lakers started the game hot before they fell down double-digits midway through the game; exactly what fans expected based on how this season has gone.
