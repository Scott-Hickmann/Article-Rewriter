War on Fakes is one of the top Telegram channels in Russia, with a reach of more than 30 million daily views. The channel presents itself as debunking the ‘information war against Russia’

The War on Fakes website is an objective source for fact-checking mis- and disinformation about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, despite its extreme pro-Russia bias.

The DFRLab is not linking directly to the webpage because Microsoft Edge and Firefox malware detectors both warn that the site is malicious.

War on Fakes is not objective, instead pushing content to support narratives echoed by Russian state media and the Kremlin.

The channel has started to receive some attention from mainstream Russian propaganda outlets. For instance, a heavily circulated photo of a Ukrainian civilian injured during a Russian airstrike in Chuhuiv was likely faked.

The photo was taken on the day of the Chuhuiv airstrike. The photographer is a well-respected photojournalist.

War on Fakes uses facial recognition algorithms to determine the likelihood that two faces are the same person. This is a considerably low score, even taking into account that one of the images includes facial injuries.

War on Fakes makes hundreds of other controversial claims, including that the corpses of Kyiv TV tower were brought in from a nearby morgue. Another post-war post-mortem footage is extremely graphic.

Despite the propagandistic quality of Russian media, the channel has gained significant traction in Russia. It was heavily amplified on the Telegram channels of key figures and outlets in Russian media. It is likely that much of War on Fakes’ growth resulted from their amplification.

War on Fakes is now dedicated to French, Spanish and Chinese. It is now attempting to expand through multiple channels and translations of its website.

The channel's extraordinary growth rate, amplification by key Russian media figures, use of conventional Russian influence tactics, and clear goal of maintaining popular support for Russia’s Ukraine.
