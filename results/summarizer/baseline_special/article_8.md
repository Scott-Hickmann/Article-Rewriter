Both grandmothers, both in their mid-80s, fled Ukraine this weekend. They left their Odessa apartment at 6 AM to the sounds of air raid sirens and traveled by bus, foot, and ferry all day. They spent the night before the next leg of their journey in Bulgaria.

The morning of my grandmothers’ departure, it was impossible to find a taxi to the bus terminal, as air raid sirens had been active during the night.

Martial law prevents men ages 18 to 60 from leaving the country. Women and children must cross the border alone.

Viber group included my grandmothers, their companion family members, and several family members on all sides.

The grandmothers got separated in the crowd at the border. Fortunately, they were able to reunite after a short search.

The photos were also helpful at the end of my family's journey.

Conserve cell phone power. Bring an external battery pack and make sure you have the right cords for your device.

My grandparents completed the first leg of the trip in good spirits. Their courage and resilience left me in awe.

Stay strong, stay safe.
