Nikita Khrushchev delivered a speech three years after Stalin’s death. He roundly criticised Stalin's foundationally dishonest, authoritarian brand of leadership.

The speech was never officially made public, but Stalin’s “cult of Soviet personality” had been revealed as a lie. The speech, which was never formally made publicly, had been made public.

There are the downright Orwellian attempts to frame Russia as  liberators instead of occupiers. There’s his portrayal of Luhansk and Donetsk as newly-independent states.

Putin tried to justify the impending economic sanctions to an assembly of oligarchs.

At least Putin's perspective, it's hard to believe that a military invasion was his preferred option. How could Ukraine’s independence possibly pose a threat to Russia?

Trump described Putin’s fabricated justifications for the Ukraine invasion as “genius” and “wonderful”

With the Russian and Ukrainian people in such close contact, it would be all but impossible to maintain hold over Ukraine.

The playbook they used, even if it's not being used to the same devastating effect, is alive and well today.

In the immortal words of Mark Twain, “Politicians and Putin’s combined 19-year run as Putin's combined 19 years run as president of Russia (achieved by exploiting loopholes) and even  North Korea’'s dynasty.

There’s the inevitable sabre-rattling when their ego is threatened, as seen during Kim Jong-un.

Leaders who try to control the reality of their people will eventually lose control of the narrative.
