Demonstrations were tamped down by Vladimir Putin. It's not just in the more cosmopolitan areas of the federation like Moscow and St Petersburg.

The Russian Federation may be trying to avoid sanctions, but it is very significant. It means there is internal dissent.

A lot of the national guard, the Rosgvardyia have been deployed to Ukraine. Many have been killed or injured. In time those testimonies should be added to war crimes.

Putin's words that only contract soldiers are on the front lines can skirt the reality.

The supply chains are so broken that a forty-mile convoy seems stuck, perhaps abandoned. The reality is that deep corruption led to a Potemkin army.

Initial reports of strikes within the Russian Federation are impossible to confirm. However, some of this is likely already happening.

Rationing of buckwheat and sugar is a terrible indicator for the working class, says John Sutter.

This is when we enter the prospect of another revolution and the further balkanization of the Russian Federation. We saw a military that was poorly provisioned and led at the end of the first world war.

The Russian economy is reeling, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: Russia's oligarchs are having a bad day since the USSR was falling apart.

The 1917 revolution was also a consequence of the disastrous Russo-Japanese war of 1905. Putin has closed the country to the world and criminalized a second Russian revolution.

Radio Free Europe provides an example of this tension.

Russia's future is a far more diminished Russian Federation. This is Putin's legacy. Whether the country survives, or not, as it presently exists is a good question.
