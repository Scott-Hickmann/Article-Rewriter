When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the American ideological system had gone the distance where that of the USSR had failed. The two empires found themselves unable to face each other directly.

The Second Cold War has begun, possibly future history books will record that world wars in the nuclear age were all cold wars. This cold war has another fundamental distinguishing factor, its ideological divide.

This is incorrect, pure economic communism anywhere in the world is long dead. Since the 1970s the Chinese government has transitioned away from traditional communism.

Some may stipulate that the First Cold War was already a competition between democracy and authoritarianism.

China and Russia are ideologically distinct and can be classified as distant on the political spectrum. But their desire to define authoritarian regimes as morally acceptable and politically superior is what unites them.

The Democracy Bloc based on the United States and its NATO allies reflects a similarly diverse ideological group. As the new cold war deepens these countries are likely to be caught in the middle.

Taiwan is the last holdover of a non-communist China and has always enjoyed the vague backing of the United States. Taiwan’s continued independence is an acknowledgement of US hegemony in a territory China considers to be its own.

China has attempted to assert its dominance over the contested South China Sea by building islands and military installations. The United States has continued to maintain a presence in the sea and contest Chinese claims.

In 2018, the United States began a long war with China over the many Chinese abuses of the economic relationship between the two countries. In the near future, it is likely that globalization will be reversed as economic ties mirror more closely the new political divisions of the Second Cold War.

Authoritarian Bloc's interference of Russia's election interference spans the globe. It is less about picking winners and more about creating instability and sowing divisions among democratic countries.

Vladimir Putin seems to have believed his own side's narrative that beset by division and inefficiency would fall by the day of authoritarianism. Putin has proven that the Democracy Bloc, at least for now, will be equal to the task.

The Democracy Bloc is determined to prove that liberal democracy prevailed in the First Cold War. The authoritarians insist that only those at the top are served by the current system.

For almost a decade, China has been advancing its foreign investment into the developing world. China has successfully made itself a viable role in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

Oft commented on the contrast between the 2008 Olympics and China’s display of power with its softer side in 2022. China wants to convince countries in the balance between the blocs that they are the best model for the future.

The summit brought together over 100 countries, not including China or Russia, to discuss the superiority of the democratic model.

As George Kennan realized at the beginning of the First Cold War, this is a zero sum game. The world order advanced by each side can only exist if the other side's does not.
