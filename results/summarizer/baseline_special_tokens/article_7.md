War on Fakes is one of the top Telegram channels in Russia, with a reach of more than 30 million daily views. The channel presents itself as debunking the “information war against Russia”

The War on Fakes' operators describe themselves on its English-language website as ‘the owners and administrators of several non-political telegram channels’ They continue, “We don’t do politics. But we consider it important to provide objective information about what is happening in Ukraine and the territories of Donbass

Microsoft Edge and Firefox malware detectors warn that the site is malicious.

War on Fakes is not objective, instead pushing content to support narratives echoed by Russian state media and the Kremlin.

The channel has started to receive some attention from mainstream Russian propaganda outlets. For instance, a heavily circulated photo of a Ukrainian civilian injured during a Russian airstrike in Chuhuiv was likely faked.

The photo was taken on the day of the Chuhuiv airstrike. The photographer is a well-respected photojournalist, Olena Kurilo.

War on Fakes uses facial recognition algorithms to determine the likelihood that two faces are the same person. This is a considerably low score, even taking into account that one of the images includes facial injuries.

Fakes on Kyiv TV tower may have been brought in from a nearby morgue. Fakes make hundreds of other highly controversial claims.

Russia's media has been amplified by prominent Russian media outlets. It is likely that much of War on Fakes’ growth resulted from their amplification.

War on Fakes is now attempting to expand through multiple channels and translations of its website into French, Spanish and Chinese.

The channel’s extraordinary growth rate, amplification by key Russian media figures, use of conventional Russian influence tactics, and clear goal of maintaining popular support for Russia's Ukraine.
