Mother had just been separated from her children as they were evacuated out of the city.

Putin is cursing Russians with that same burden. Germans have spent 80 years apologising for what their predecessors did.

My grandfather liberated Belsen concentration camp and never really recovered from what he saw. That deep hatred lasts for generations, not years, says author.

Ukraine is not a far-away place with which we have no emotional ties. Westerners have been there for holidays, and Ukrainians live and work in towns and cities across Europe and America.

Everything Russian is being boycotted — the Russian economy is now toxic. Putin failed to understand that Ukraine is already Europe, he is far too late to prevent that.

Putin has quickly made Russia hated around the world. From UN votes, to boycotts, Russia has very, very few friends.

When I was growing up in the 1970s and 1980s plenty of the older generation around me refused to buy German or Japanese products. What we would now consider racist jokes about Germans were completely acceptable.

Germany is no coincidence that despite travelling all over Europe, I only visited Germany for the first time in my 30s.

Germany is a new country, with new generations of people, and both have set an impressive example.

The full gravity of what his grandparents’ generation had done had just started to sink in.

He was a British Jew and a young German in a wonderfully diverse and open city, embracing. It was OK now, but I knew he would spend the coming years working out how to disentangle himself from his country's history.

Germany is a great nation and a beacon for peace and freedom. It is tough, unfair, and a betrayal of them by previous generations.

All Russians will start to experience hatred, racism, aggression, sideways glances, animosity. They may be the best and kindest people, they may be anti-Putin activists, but they are now under the shadow of his crimes.

By the end of this war, many of us in the West will have seen streets in Ukraine that we have walked down bombed to rubble. If the Russian army kills my friends, I will never forget that or forgive it. It will shape my whole relationship with Russia for the rest of my life.

The war is not a rational response, but it is inevitable. It is unfair on all those thousands of Russians who have been arrested for protesting against this war.

Putin has re-written Russian history from a failed dictatorship into an aggressor that brought death and destruction to Europe. It is already too late for him, and for Russia now, says Peter Bergen.

Like Hitler and Stalin, he will be hated forever, says author.

The damage Putin has done to Russia is greater than all the harm he has done over the last few decades. The veils of civility have fallen, the lustre of Russian money is tarnished. The party is over for the oligarchs, and the West will now start to shift away from tolerating both Russian aggression and Russian money

Ukraine will never forgive Russia for its crimes against Ukraine over the last century. For the rest of the world, Russia will spend a generation or more rebuilding its image.

History has seen Hitler set out to build a greater Germany, and he is also destroying Russia. By the time he is finished, he will have scarred generations of hatred, pain, and grief into the collective memory of the Ukrainian people.
