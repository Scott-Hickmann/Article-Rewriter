Vladimir Putin has tamped down rumors of martial law in Russia.

This is a client state of the Russian Federation, not unlike Chechnya. It means there is internal dissent.

Many have been killed or injured in the Ukraine conflict. Some are in captivity at this point.

Putin's words that only contract soldiers are on the front lines can skirt the reality.

Russian oligarchs bought all the yachts, planes, and houses abroad. The reality is that deep corruption led to a Potemkin army.

Initial reports of strikes within the Russian Federation are impossible to confirm. However, some of this is likely already happening.

Rationing of buckwheat and sugar is a terrible indicator for the working class, says John Sutter.

This is when we enter the prospect of another revolution and the further balkanization of the Russian Federation. We saw a military that was poorly provisioned and led at the end of the first world war.

The USSR could not keep the lights on, or the buckwheat on the shelves. The Baltic States and Ukraine came to be independent.

The 1917 revolution was also a consequence of the disastrous Russo-Japanese war of 1905. These days pressure cookers tend to move faster.

Radio Free Europe provides an example of this tension.

Russia cannot hide the level of this disaster. This is Putin's legacy.
