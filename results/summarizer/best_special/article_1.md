This morning I woke up to the hopeful news that some Russian forces are [pulling back from the border](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60392259) with Ukraine.

[like Anne Applebaum](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/lavrov-russia-diplomacy-ukraine/622075/) pretend this means Russians are always lying, but this isn't at all the case.

Russia has done for the past year makes perfect sense if you accept that what Putin is after is in fact very simple.

Ukraine itself probably won't be around in ten years and its member states know it. In exchange European leaders get a ready-made excuse to let American taxpayers to fund defense spending European countries ought to be providing themselves.

NATO allowed Hungary and Czechoslovakia to fall to Moscow when Joe Biden was young, and the only battles it has ever fought have been against Serbian and Taliban militants.

Russian leaders like Putin don't look at the present and assume it will continue forever. But Russian leaders like Vladimir don’t lookat the present but assume it’s.

Americans want to pretend that autocrats like Putin aren't accountable to anyone, but this isn't strictly true. The Russian people could revolt against their oppressive government, but few ever will so long as the economy is okay.

Ukraine continues to insist [Crimea and Donbas belong to it](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210823-ukraine-opens-international-summit-calling-for-return-of-crimea-from-russia)could *be in a decade. A future nightmare scenario haunts Moscow's dreams, a scenario where Ukraine joins NATO then tries to reclaim these territories, plunging Russia into a conflict it might not be prepared for.*

From Putin's perspective Ukraine must be neutralized, and the fact the Zelensky government refuses to shelve NATO membership amplifies his concerns.

Major Russian forces [historically deployed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/15/heres-what-we-know-about-russias-military-buildup-near-ukraine/) in Siberia have been moved to the western military districts.

Putin does not want to undertake a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. But he's willing to go down this road if he feels he must and he might if his objectives cannot be achieved any other way.

American leaders are obsessed with the concept of [deterrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory), making the critical error in failing to think from Putin's perspective.

American deterrence fails when an opponent decides the costs America says it is willing to impose are irrelevant. Sanctions are a means of looking tough to a domestic audience and little more.

Russia and China are [officially strong allies now](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-china-forge-closer-ties-us-preoccupied-struggles-home-rcna15722), like the US and UK. Because America under Biden has refused to see sense and work out a long-term stable pact to prevent any war over Taiwan or the South China Sea, China has no reason to restrain Putin.

Public proclamations of NATO unity [are covering up deep cracks between the main continental European participants, Germany and France, and the US/UK.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/world/europe/nato-russia-ukraine-europe.html)

Putin has now successfully bluffed the US and UK into [pulling advisers out of Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/12/pentagon-orders-departure-of-us-troops-in-ukraine.html)Pulling no assistance [if they're caught in the fighting or, y’know, have Ukrainian families who can't just up and leave. The threat of conflict means airlines are stopping service.](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/11/1080060546/biden-us-citizens-leave-ukraine)

The idea that Russia will attack Ukraine out of nowhere is frankly silly, because he gains far more by exhausting Ukraine over time with constant aggressive maneuvers Kyiv can't ignore than a massive invasion.

Russian intelligence has been aggressively working on a maskirovka campaign specifically designed to gaslight American and allied intelligence.

Putin has been able to trap him in a dynamic where America looks like its crying chicken little every five minutes.

Putin pulling back some troops from the border ahead of the new German chancellor Scholz is a classic technique.

Russia insists Ukraine is plotting an offensive in Donbas that will harm Russian people.

Russia's military buildup has been slow and deliberate over the past year, punctuated with sudden movements under the guise of exercises.



American and British media have been [hyping the danger of a false-flag attack](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/us-intelligence-russia-false-flag/index.html). Everyone will believe what they want to.

Both American and Russian sources hinted at the other side launching some kind of chemical weapons attack, which is classic in false-flag operations.

When one is launched, no one will be sure who actually did it for some time. It took months of direct inspections to prove [Syria used chemical weapons in Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_chemical_weapons_in_the_Syrian_civil_war), and many key facts are still afflicted by public doubt.

People on both sides will believe what their leaders and media insist is true. Just like Americans are fighting with each other over what actually happened in the Capitol Attack, so will the pundits in America and Russia insist the other side is telling lies.

There are now two basic possibilities for how the Ukraine crisis ends. One is a major blowup that triggers a Russian ultimatum to Zelensky.

Germany convinces Putin [that it will prevent Ukraine from joining NATO through setting clear conditions on membership Kyiviviv](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/scholz-flies-moscow-bid-avert-war-2022-02-15/)Germany's hope is that Ukraine will remain Russian plus an effective demilitar zone buffering the two sides along their mutual borders are also going to to be necessary to be able to meet for twenty years.

Ukraine stands alone Putin can keep ratche up pressure on Kyiv until he gets what he wants or Zelensky falls, creating an opening an opening for a coup and sudden deployment of military forces at the invitation of the new regime.

Neutralize the threat of Ukraine joining NATO anytime soon2. 
3. Maintain control over the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbas
4.

A paltry few American combat troops dispatched to feign real commitment, it is clear that Putin has already achieved 3 and 4.4.

So now Putin aims to resolve 1 and 2. He would clearly prefer to win through negotiation, but it is apparent that he is committed to victory even at serious cost to Russia’s international reputation and long-term relationship with Ukraine.

Ukraine will always be the same people, a big war will permanently sever whatever bonds remain. Even if an insurgency doesn't kill hundreds of Russian soldiers, eventually Ukraine will be free again.

Russia's newly-professional military is as casualty averse and reliant on firepower as America's. Because this truth runs up against objective 5, all-out conquest is the most likely outcome.

A limited operation opens the door to further conquest through non-military means.

The Transatlantic Alliance will always be hindered by [America’s ongoing collapse](https://medium.com/gen/fourth-america-is-almost-over-americans-want-a-divorce-9367a5d50df7), a process Russia can now actively intensify if it chooses.

Ukraine is running away just like it did in Afghanistan, Biden entirely concerned about his domestic audience and pitiful chances at re-election in 2024.

Putin's maskirovka is designed to obscure his core aims. Objective 5 is on his horizon, but Putin is savvy enough to realize he doesn't get it if there's an all-out war.

Russia can simply sit back and bombard Ukraine for days or weeks with weapons Ukraine can't stop. A direct invasion of Ukraine at any point will follow an initial campaign intended to paralyze and crush Ukraine’s armed forces in the east.

Russia makes several moves that keep a door open to negotiations and imply a willingness to back down.

Russia insists it's not invading anyone, just supporting people under attack.

Russia's forces surrounding Ukraine give Putin options he can elect to deploy one at a time or all at once.

Russia has learned Clausewitz’ lesson better than anyone. But America's strategy has failed and is probably making everything worse.

U.S. leaders are too ignorant of geography, history, and systems to be trusted in this crisis. Only Europe can deal with Russia.
