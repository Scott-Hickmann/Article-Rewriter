People don't like to talk about how the very concept of ‘NFT value” is extremely complicated.

As an educator, I attest that these questions are not dumb. Everyone who understands NFTs more deeply was required to answer these questions for themselves at some point in their journey from JPEG to DAO.

Technology allows NFTs to behave kind of like baseball cards, with a verified owner.

The owner has the rights to sell it or commercialize it.

4.

Most valuable NFTs are a part of a recognized collection and some collections have become quite famous and desirable.



The idea of a community of owners is built-in to the very concept of every NFT collection is actually “community”.

6. So are NFTs just a way to buy friends?

NFTs these days have moved beyond the artwork attached to them. Others allow you to be a part-owner in a real-world asset, such as a business.

7.

NFTs are revolutionary in the sense that they make membership or ownership easily buyable, sellable.

8. Are NFTs a fad?

NFTs have dramatically risen in popularity but usually do not stay popular for very long. But although the value of NFTs is completely determined by the community, this isn't as alarming as it seems.

**People can buy, sell, and profit from their NFTs, the essence of an NFT collection is actually the community organized by virtue of shared ownership of virtual assets.**

People are thinking up new ways to use NFTs every day. Like I mentioned before, NFT owners have attempted to buy entire sports teams (or even even the Constitution of the United States)

The next time someone tells you they've got NFTs all figured out, think twice before inviting them to your Web3 dinner party.
