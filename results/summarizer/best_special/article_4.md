Our brothers and sisters in Ukraine are under attack from a vastly superior fighting force.

The world is so absurdly reliant on Russian energy exports.

Ukraine is so desperate that it plans to [hand out guns to citizens in the streets](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1496785547594924032).

Most likely, the Russian goal is to surround Kyiv and force the collapse of Ukraine “Russia” by summer, but once he's in total control, he’ll re-install a proxy power.

Putin says he feels like Ukraine is a threat to his gigantic nation.

Once Ukraine joins NATO, he'll have a full-scale enemy on his doorstep. But Russia has *constantly invaded Russia **once** since its creation.*

The stated goal of Putin's "special operation" is to [demilitarize and de-Nazify the Jewish-led nation](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-military-invade-b2022046.html).

Ukraine to remain undefended by NATO so he can keep **[and theand the **other two regions**](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1569684/Russia-Ukraine-Vladimir-Putin-separatist-states-evg)** **[**two,000 years**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea)**

Ukraine pipelines move a *lot of Russian energy products to market.*

Russia has no qualms about [starving millions of Ukrainians to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) to feed its people.

Putin wants Russia to own [everything it has ever owned in history.](https://snyder.substack.com/p/how-to-think-about-war-in-ukraine)

This whole saga started when [a Jewish TV comedian played a teacher who gets elected President after going on a rant about corruption.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9smD823aE0)

President Zelenskyy won the hearts and minds of Ukrainian citizens because he *cast a vision of a fairer world*.

The West will respond with economic sanctions meant to [cripple the Russian economy](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/boris-johnson-vows-cripple-dictator-121327747.html).

A hard crash or long-term depression will cause untold suffering for our Russian brothers and sisters. All this creates even more suffering and hardship for the poor and working-class in the West.

Russia is just following America’s playbook. Some of us believe that *all* war is morally wrong, no matter who perpetrates it. But let's not pretend the West is innocent right now.

Russia invaded Ukraine to solidify its grip on two eastern regions.

Pray and/or meditate about what actions we are to personally take with our families.2. 
3. Stop buying Russian products (vodka obviously, but more importantly, pay the extra to switch from oil/solar/geothermal/etc.)
4. [-

More war won't fix this planet or change corrupt hearts, my friends.
