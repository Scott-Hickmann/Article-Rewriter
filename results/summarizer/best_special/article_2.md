The American ideological system had gone the distance where that of the USSR had failed. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States emerged with an unquestioned military and political hegemony over the entire globe.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has ignited a touchpaper that merely future history books will record that world wars in the nuclear age were all cold wars.

Second, some may stipulate that the First Cold War was already a competition between democracy and authoritarianism. This contention simply does not survive historical examination.

Now as the Second Cold War begins, it is apparent that left right political ideologies are increasingly meaningless for understanding what is happening. But their desire to define authoritarian regimes as morally acceptable and politically superior is what unites them.

The other side hereafter referred to as as the Democracy Bloc based on the United States and its NATO allies reflects a similarly diverse ideological group.

This new cold war can truly be said to be in full swing because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine but the areas of conflict span the globe and have been active for some time already. Taiwan's continued independence is an acknowledgement of US hegemony in a territory China considers to be its own.

Taiwan has attempted to assert its dominance over the contested South China Sea by building islands and military installations and threatening those that pass through.

The range of hot or hard power conflicts extends beyond the military realm to economics and clandestine activities, just as they did during the First Cold War. In 2018, the United States began a probably overdue [trade war](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/01/01/new-research-counts-the-costs-of-the-sino-american-trade-war) with China over the many Chinese abuses of the economic relationship between the two countries.

Russia[Russia](https://www.csis.org/blogs/technology-policy-blog/russia-ramps-global-elections-interference-lessons-united-states) has launched concerted efforts of misinformation campaigns and election interference with the obvious intention of destabilizing democratic countries.

The Democracy Bloc is determined to prove that liberal democracy prevailed in the First Cold War for a reason while the authoritarians insist that only those at the top are served by the current system.

China has been advancing its foreign investment, mostly via [its Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative), into the developing world.

China has just witnessed a display of these ambitions via the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

The summit brought together over 100 countries, not including China or Russia, to discuss the superiority of the democratic model and ways in which the democracies can improve themselves.

As Russian tanks roll across the Ukraine and Chinese advances in global leadership continue there can be be no doubt that a new worldwide cold war has emerged. This time the dividing line can be found between democratic and authoritarian political regimes.
