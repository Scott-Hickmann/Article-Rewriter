A scan of the channel’s posts makes it clear that War on Fakes is not objective, instead pushing content to support narratives echoed by Russian state media and the Kremlin.

The channel has started to receive some attention from mainstream Russian propaganda outlets.

The claim that the photo is staged has been [debunked](https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/ca6d93d1), as metadata showed that the picture was in fact taken on the day of the Chuhiv airstrike.

The DFRLab subsequently ran the image provided by War on Fakes through Microsoft Azure’s Face Verification tool, which uses facial recognition algorithms to determine the likelihood that two faces are the same person.

War on Fakes makes hundreds of other highly controversial claims, including that the corpses seen in photos of an attack on a Kyiv TV tower may have been brought in from a nearby morgue.

The channel has gained significant traction domestically in Russia, and continues to be amplified by prominent Russian outlets.

War on Fakes is now attempting to expand through multiple region-specific channels and translations of its website into French, Spanish and Chinese.
