My grandmothers, both in their mid to late 80s, fled Ukraine this weekend, a feat we did not think we would be able to achieve, not only because of their age but also because of the rapidly deteriorating conflict.

Use social media for the most up-to-date information.

Martial law prevents men ages 18 to 60 from leaving the country. Over the next 24 hours, they helped each other by carrying bags, exchanging cell phone battery packs, and sharing information.

A group allowed us to share information quickly and to conserve scarce cell phone power.

My grandmothers got separated in the day of the trip and share it with loved ones.

The photos were also helpful at the end of my family's journey, when their cell phone batteries and roaming credits were depleted.

My grandmother's companion shared her location with her family using a “pin.” This was immensely valuable not only for our peace of mind but also to help estimate arrival times at borders or at the final destination.

If you're traveling in a group, take turns keeping your phones on.

Keep the faith. My grandmother, a survivor of WWII and now the War in Ukraine, told me upon her arrival to Bulgaria,

Stay strong, stay safe.
