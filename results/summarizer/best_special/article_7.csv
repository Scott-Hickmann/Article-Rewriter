It quickly skyrocketed; within two weeks, War on Fakes grew to over 625,000 subscribers and is now one of the top Telegram channels in Russia, with a reach of more than 30 million daily views. The channel, which presents itself as debunking the “information war against Russia,” spreads disinformation and propaganda under the façade of a fact-checking service. Its staggering growth since its inception indicates it may be gaining traction more broadly, including through the publishing of an English-language (MD2)website(MD2).(MD0)"

Its commentary refers to the war in Ukraine exclusively as the “special operation in Ukraine” (“спецоперация в Украине”), following Kremlin policy to not refer to the situation as a “war” or “invasion.” Although not all of its posts are completely falsified, they use alternative explanations to spin context, question facts, and promote wild suggestions of hired actors and staged atrocities — all common tactics in (MD1)Russian influence operations and propaganda(MD1).(MD0)"

This was also reposted by Vladimir Soloviev, a (MD3)well-known(MD3) Russian journalist and propagandist.(MD0)"

When an original photo of Kurilo is compared with the photo that War on Fakes claims is also her, it provides a 29 percent confidence that these photos are the same person. This is a considerably low score, even taking into account that one of the images includes facial injuries, suggesting that while these two may look alike, it is highly unlikely that the person in the original photo is Kurilo.(MD0)"

It received a further boost when it was recently promoted by the Russian Foreign Ministry. As each of these channels have hundreds of thousands of followers, it is likely that much of War on Fakes’ growth resulted from their amplification, which in turn allowed those channels to use War on Fakes’ “objective” analysis to counter any news coming out of Ukraine that might negatively impact public opinion in Russia. War on Fakes’ posts have now been cited as legitimate fact-checks on hundreds of Russian media sites, including (MD6)(MD2)RT(MD2)(MD6) on multiple occasions.(MD0)"
