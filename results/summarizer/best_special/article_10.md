How big of a basketball AND LeBron James fan I am. For those that do not know me, you will quickly learn about my passion for the game.

Basketball, to me, is an educational tool. One might say I'm a nerd when it comes to hoops. But all of this is important.

***Basketball.***

Last night, the Golden State Warriors visited the Los Angeles Lakers for a prime-time game on national television.

Golden State was the heavy favorite for bettors. All the stars were out in LA for this matchup.

The Lakers started the game hot before they fell down double-digits midway through the game; exactly what fans expected based on how this season has gone.

The next 9 minutes of basketball was straight out of a movie. Everyone was in awe of what they were witnessing.

Both teams went back and forth the entire quarter as both teams desperately needed a win.

LeBron James, who's carried multiple franchises all throughout his 19-year career, had just done it again.

This win completely changed the complexion of this season. This team's chance to make a postseason run feels real.

A family member of mine who doesn't follow basketball too closely enjoyed the luxury of being at the game in Los Angeles. The city found the glimmer of hope they needed for this season.

This team still has many issues to overcome, but if you asked most Lakers fans before last night,

As long as you got LeBron fucking James on your team, you've always got a chance.
