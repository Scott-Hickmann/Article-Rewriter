In 1956, three years after Stalin's death, Russia’s First Party Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, delivered a speech called, [On The Cult Of Personality And Its Consequences](https://www.ht.lu.se/media/utbildning/dokument/kurser/EUHA14/20121/Nikita_S._Khrushchev__The_Secret_Speech_On_the_Cult_of_Personality_1956.pdf)

Once Stalin's “cult of personality” had been revealed as a lie, all that was left was reality.

Ukraine is being run by [drug addicts and Neo-Nazis](https://youtu.be/dTw3hWa3E8M). There are the downright Orwellian attempts to frame Russia as [liberators instead of occupiers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/pure-orwell-how-russian-state-media-spins-ukraine-invasion-as-liberation).

Putin tried to justify the impending economic sanctions to an assembly of oligarchs stood out:

Ukraine's independence possibly pose a threat to Russia's security at such great “risk”?

It's no coincidence that Trump, the president of “[alternative facts](https://youtu.be/VSrEEDQgFc8)" and “fake news” described Putin's fabricated justifications for the Ukraine invasion as “[genius](https://youtu.be/cRpeJpBYXVs)” and "wonderful”.

Ukraine's embrace of democracy and recent efforts to join the European Union represented a country, right on Russia's doorstep, whose thoughts Putin couldn't control. With the Russian and Ukrainian people in such close contact, it would be all but impossible to maintain his hold over their reality.

The playbook they used, even if it it's not being used to the same devastating effect, is alive and well today.

Modern-day dictators still cling to power.

There's the inevitable sabre-rattling when their ego is threatened.

A leader whose power is built on lies feels as if he's losing control of the narrative.
