What ensued was a conflict of more than 40 years between the two dominant powers of the globe. Armed with ever expanding nuclear arsenals the two empires found themselves unable to face each other directly. Instead, their ideological rivalry devolved into clandestine strikes, economic power grabs, and open warfare that engulfed every corner of the globe. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States emerged with an unquestioned military and political hegemony over the entire globe. The American ideological system had gone the distance where that of the USSR had failed.(MD0)"

Regardless, the Second Cold War has begun. Much like the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Nazi invasion of Poland, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has ignited a touchpaper that merely crystalized long simmering tensions and divisions. While Russia is again a rival of the US and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) led bloc, this time around they are very much the (MD1)junior partner(MD1) of the powerful and ascendant People’s Republic of China. This cold war has another fundamental distinguishing factor, its ideological divide. In place of the duel between capitalist and communist economic systems is a political divide between democratic and authoritarian systems. This Second Cold War will either be the grave of liberal democracy or its greatest triumph since World War II.(MD0)"
State control still abounds but rigorous central economic planning and collectivization does not.,"China is yet another communist power challenging the capitalist world, says author. Since the 1970s the Chinese government has transitioned away from traditional communism.",(MD0)(MD1)State control still abounds but rigorous central economic planning and collectivization does not.(MD0),"(MD0)Overly simplistic analyses will suggest that this new cold war can be conceived within a similar framework to the old one for two different reasons. First, it will be suggested that China is yet another communist power challenging the capitalist world. This is incorrect, pure economic communism anywhere in the world is long dead. Since the 1970’s the Chinese government has transitioned away from traditional communism and embraced a unique amalgam that can be described as (MD1)authoritarian capitalism(MD1), for lack of a better term. State control still abounds but rigorous central economic planning and collectivization does not. Competition and innovation are actively encouraged within the bounds the state sets. Meanwhile, socialist ideas and policies have reached varying degrees of acceptability and implementation across the democratic world.(MD0)"

This contention simply does not survive historical examination. While both of the primary combatants, particularly the United States, claimed to be fighting democracy’s cause, it was never more than a secondary concern, if that. The developing world was rife with corrupt and or authoritarian regimes that were propped up or supported by the United States because of the commitment of those regimes to anti-communism. Meanwhile, while authoritarianism followed closely behind Soviet Communism, the USSR was always committed to the expansion of the communist system and had little love for authoritarian states that remained outside their ideological grasp.(MD0)"

The Democracy Bloc does also have some awkward allies like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, that violate the bloc’s principles. As the new cold war deepens these countries are likely to be caught in the middle. Ultimately, ideology counts for little. What matters in this new cold war is the organizing political principle of a country’s regime be it democratic as in based on limits on power and free and fair elections or authoritarian with arbitrary executive power.(MD0)"
This new cold war can truly be said to be in full swing because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine but the areas of conflict span the globe and have been active for some time already.

Perhaps the next hottest location can be said to be (MD1)Taiwan(MD1). For some time now the Chinese military has made preparations for a future invasion of Taiwan even as the United States and its allies have (MD2)strategized(MD2) for its defense. China has several strategic and economic reasons for the conquest of Taiwan but perhaps the most important motivation is symbolic. Taiwan is the last holdover of a non-communist China and has always enjoyed the vague backing of the United States. Taiwan’s continued independence is an acknowledgement of US hegemony in a territory China considers to be its own. Conquest of Taiwan would signal once and for all that China is an equal of the United States that cannot be cowed or intimidated. For the United States it would be the death knell of long waning American global dominance. Taiwan is therefore key to the new cold war because it could lead to direct conflict between the main combatants.(MD0)

Since the United Kingdom returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 the city had served as an oasis of democracy and civil liberties in a desert of authoritarianism. Starting in 2019 Beijing imposed strict restrictions on the city and brutally repressed democracy advocates over the meaningless verbal objections of western leaders. China also employed one of its most powerful tools, gatekeeping of access to its large internal market, to (MD2)intimidate(MD2) and silence western critics of its repression. Meanwhile, China has attempted to assert its dominance over the contested South China Sea by building islands and military installations and threatening those that pass through. This has direct consequences for several countries in the region including Taiwan. The United States has continued to maintain a presence in the sea and contest Chinese claims. Recently, military exercises have seen several other (MD3)members(MD3) of the Democracy Bloc aid in contesting the South China Sea. Recently, the United States also agreed to share its nuclear submarine technology for only the second time in a (MD4)treaty(MD4) with Australia and the United Kingdom. This is a move to further strengthen the hand of the Democracy Bloc against China and has drawn several Chinese rebukes and objections.(MD0)"
