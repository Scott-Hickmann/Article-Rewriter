Today my friend in Kyiv, a mother who had just been separated from her children as they were evacuated out of the city.

Putin is cursing Russians with that same burden.

Ukraine has been open to the world ever since it kicked out his last puppet dictator. Ukraine is not a far-away place with which we have no emotional ties (as may be, to our shame, the case with Chechnya and Syria)

Russia, as a brand, is now so poisonous that no business can afford any connection with it. Everyone is siding with Ukraine.

Putin has quickly made Russia hated around the world.

Germany was openly hated and mocked. What we would now consider racist jokes about Germans were completely hated.



Germany is a new country, with new generations of people, and both have set an impressive example when it comes to owning and building positively on their history.

A few years ago I was out one night in Berlin. We went over to ask if he was ok. He was a little drunk, feeling the full weight of history press down on him.

We sat with him for some time, talking. But I knew he would spend the coming years working out how to disentangle himself from his country's history.

Germany such a great German struggle with their history, try to understand what being German means in the shadow of the last century. It is tough, unfair, and a betrayal of them by previous generations.

A Russian couple were sitting opposite me chatting in Russian. I felt myself myself looking up at them, I noticed other people looking at them.

If the Russian army kills my friends, I will never forget that or forgive it. It will shape my whole relationship with Russia for the rest of my life.

Our children will grow up with stories of this war, with the raw grief and anger we are feeling. Once it starts to kill people we know, we will find it hard not to hold them accountable â€” it was their country, their leader, and their army.

Putin has re-written Russian history from a failed dictatorship into an aggressor that brought death and destruction to Europe.

As time passes, he will never be forgiven. Like Hitler and Stalin, even the most brainwashed Russians will understand the truth about Putin.

Russia will have to disentangle themselves from these crimes just as young Germans have had to do. But the West will now start to shift away from tolerating both Russian aggression and Russian money.

Ukraine will never forgive Russia. A visceral, almost genetic anger and hatred will now flow down through the generations. Even after Putin falls, which is now a certainty, and even if someone like Navalny manages to come to power and rebuild the country into some sort of vaguely functioning democracy, Russia will always have this war in its history.

Hitler set out to build a greater Germany, and ended up destroying everywhere else including Germany. By the time he is finished, he will have scarred generations of hatred, pain, and grief into the collective memory of the Ukrainian people.
