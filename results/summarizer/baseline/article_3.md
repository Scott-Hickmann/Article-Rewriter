In 1956, three years after Stalin’s death, Nikita Khrushchev delivered a speech called,  [*on The Cult Of Personality And Its Consequences.*](https://www.ht.lu.se/media/utbildning/dokument/kurser/EUHA14/20121/Nikita_S._Khrushchev__The_Secret_Speech_On_the_Cult_of_Personality_1956.pdf)

Once Stalin’s ‘cult of personality’ had been revealed as a lie, all that was left was reality.

There are the downright Orwellian attempts to frame Russia as [liberators instead of occupiers. There’s his portrayal of Luhansk and Donetsk as ( MD3)plucky, newly-independent states](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/pure-orwell-how-russian-state-media-spins-ukraine-invasion-as-liberation) when they’ve been [Russia-controlled, totalitarian statelets(MD4](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/22/what-are-donetsk-and-luhansk-ukraines-separatist-statelets)

Putin's remarks as he tried to justify the impending economic sanctions to an assembly of oligarchs stood out.

The question is, what is putting Russia's security at such great risk? How could Ukraine's independence possibly pose a threat to Russia’s existence?

Trump described Putin’s fabricated justifications for the Ukraine invasion as “[genius( MD2) and “wonderful”](https://youtu.be/cRpeJpBYXVs)

Ukraine's embrace of democracy and recent efforts to join the European Union represented a country right on Russia's doorstep.

The playbook they used, even if it's not being used to the same devastating effect, is alive and well today.

Modern-day dictators still cling to power, as evidenced by North Korea's [74 year Kim dynasty](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/apr/30/history-north-koreas-kim-dynasty/), Putin's combined 19-year run as president of Russia  [and Trump's desperate bid to overturn the 2020 election.](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/explained-russias-putin-signs-law-to-stay-in-power-until-2036-whats-the-change.html)

There's the inevitable sabre-rattling when their ego is threatened.

Leaders who try to control the reality of their people will eventually have to shed blood to maintain the illusion.

A selection of heartfelt, heated, and hilarious conversations about race, politics and culture.
