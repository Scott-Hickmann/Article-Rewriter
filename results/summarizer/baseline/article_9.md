People are forced into distorted characterizations by the media, who roundly criticize these depictions.

The answer to every question is a necessary step toward grasping the value of the NFT.

NFTs are pieces of the internet that can actually be owned. They exist permanently in a virtual record book that can never be changed, only added-onto.

Only the owner has the rights to sell it or commercialize it.

NFTs sell for so much then?

The CryptoPunks collection is recognized as the first NFT collection ever created.

It is easy to verify online whether your NFT is part of a recognized collection or not.

The idea of a community of owners is built-in to the concept of every NFT collection.

NFTs are just a way to buy friends.

Some NFTs allow you to be a part-owner in a real-world asset, such as a business. Others let you directly support your favorite musical artists.

Why do you need NFTs to join a club or invest in a business?

NFTs are revolutionary in the sense that they make membership or ownership easily buyable, sellable, and transferable among individuals through online marketplaces. Ownership is easily verified online by looking at your digital wallet.

Are NFTs a fad?

NFTs are simply an evolution of what many perceive to be valuable.

The essence of an NFT collection is actually the community organized by virtue of shared ownership of virtual assets.

NFTs are redefining ownership in surprising and unconventional ways. Recently, NFT owners have attempted to buy entire sports teams (or even the Constitution of the United States!). Others are using NFT's for political organization.

Think twice before inviting them to your Web3 dinner party.
