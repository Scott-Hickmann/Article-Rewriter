When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the American ideological system had gone the distance where that of the USSR had failed. The two empires found themselves unable to face each other directly.

The Second Cold War will either be the grave of liberal democracy or its greatest triumph since World War II. This cold war has another fundamental distinguishing factor, its ideological divide.

Since the 1970s the Chinese government has transitioned away from communist power. This is incorrect, pure economic communism anywhere in the world is long dead.

Some may stipulate that the First Cold War was already a competition between democracy and authoritarianism.

China and Russia are ideologically distinct and can be classified as distant on the political spectrum. But their desire to define authoritarian regimes as morally acceptable and politically superior is what unites them.

The Democracy Bloc based on the United States and its NATO allies reflects a similarly diverse ideological group. As the new cold war deepens these countries are likely to be caught in the middle.

Taiwan is the last holdover of a non-communist China and has always enjoyed the vague backing of the United States. Taiwan’s continued independence is an acknowledgement of US hegemony in a territory China considers to be its own.

Taiwan is part of a Second Cold War showdown that is mirrored in events in Hong Kong. China has attempted to assert its dominance over the contested South China Sea by building islands and military installations.

US companies have begun a slow shift away from China as the rivalry between the two countries has grown. In the near future, it is likely that globalization will be reversed as economic ties mirror the new political divisions of the Second Cold War.

Authoritarian Bloc's influence spans the globe, impacting Europe, Latin America, and Asia. It is less about picking winners and more about creating instability and sowing divisions among democratic countries.

The most pressing and alarming hot conflict of the new cold war is Ukraine, the largest European war since the end of World War II. Vladimir Putin seems to have believed his own side's narrative that beset by division and inefficiency the democracies would fall by the day of authoritarianism dawned.

The Democracy Bloc is determined to prove that liberal democracy prevailed in the First Cold War.

As of 2020, China has surpassed the United States as the world's biggest trading partner. This is the area where the disastrous “America first’s foreign policy of the Trump administration has done its most damage.

China has made no secrets of its designs on global leadership. The world has just witnessed a display of these ambitions via the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. China wants desperately to convince countries in the balance between the blocs that they are the best model for the future.

The summit brought together over 100 countries, not including China or Russia, to discuss the superiority of the democratic model.

As George Kennan realized at the beginning of the First Cold War, this is a zero sum game. The world order advanced by each side can only exist if the other side's does not.
