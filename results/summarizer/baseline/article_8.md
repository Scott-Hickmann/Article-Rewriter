The route they took was closed the very next day due to fighting and bombing in the area.

The morning of my grandmothers’ departure, it was impossible to find a taxi to the bus terminal. Fortunately, a private driver replied to my Telegram request at 3 AM and kindly dispatched someone to arrive by 6 AM.

Martial law prevents men ages 18 to 60 from leaving the country. Women and children must cross the border alone.

The group allowed us to share information quickly and efficiently.

The family got separated in the crowd at the border. Fortunately, they were able to reunite after a short search.

The photos were also helpful at the end of my family’s journey, when their cell phone batteries and roaming credits were depleted.

The feature was immensely valuable for our peace of mind and also to help estimate arrival times at borders or at the final destination.

Turn off wifi and bluetooth, or set the phone to airplane mode. Bring an external battery pack and make sure you have the right cords for your device.

Despite a very long, stressful, and difficult journey, my grandparents completed the first leg of the trip in good spirits. Their courage and resilience left me in awe.

Stay strong, stay safe.
