The Warriors have been one of the league’s top teams all year despite a recent slide; I wish I could say the same for the Lakers.

The Lakers are led by an all-time talent and resume in LeBron James, who’s put together a phenomenal performance in his 19th-season. Still, at age 37, even he cannot will this Lakers team to win night after night. It’s a terrible reality for a fanbase that’s accustomed to championships — anything short of that is a failure of a season, especially when you’ve got LeBron James on your team. Even for the most optimistic fans, this Lakers season is as good as over."
