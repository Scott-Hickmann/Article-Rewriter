There is a very good [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) available to learn Rust.
[Solana Tool Suit](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) — This includes the Solana CLI.
The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/anmoldh121/solana-counter).
`program` — This is the directory of Solana programs (Smart contracts)
`test` — This is where javascript test code lives
`migrations` — This is the deploy script
`app` — This is where frontend is going to be built
Let’s look at our `lib.rs` file in the program directory.

"In the above code we have defined two structs, the `CounterAccount` struct is our `Account` contains a count variable that is going to store our count."
"The `Create` struct is our instruction struct that defines our context for creating an account, that is saying, “Hey I want to create an account counter\_account with the space 32 byte”."
The `#[account(…)]` attributes define constraints and instructions in preprocessing done by Anchor to create context.
`create` function is our handler for rpc request which takes the context created with `Create` struct.

This is when [Victor Monginet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-monginet) entered the game joining Doctrine a year ago.
He drafted an [RFC](https://medium.com/doctrine/doctrine-engineering-principles-and-practices-7faab666fac9) around how Server-Side Rendering (SSR) could solve this pain.
For API REST end-points we decided to keep the architecture simple so we proxied all the requests to the old server through the new one with the [Next.js’ rewrite feature](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites).
To double down this point we created a benchmark of **357** decisions URLs that we considered important to us and we computed an average response time.
**_SSR_** _→ Pure Server-side rendering part_
**_SANITIZE_** _→ SEO Optimization of the HTML generated by SSR_
**_REF_** **_DECISIONS_** _→ Loading of recommendations on the right side of the page which are normally rendered asynchronously_
We are even prouder of our value about challenging the status quo that fosters an ambitious initiative [backed by RFC](https://medium.com/doctrine/doctrine-engineering-principles-and-practices-7faab666fac9).
A key bonus is the pleasure of using cutting-edge technologies for current or [future talents that will join us](https://jobs.lever.co/doctrine/?team=Engineering).

"• **Pay close attention to little details.** Maybe it’s something like, “I’ll have to leave in 15 minutes because tonight is my son’s graduation” or “Next weekend, my husband and I will visit Yosemite.” This information can serve as the perfect ice-breaker the next time you meet."

"**Tell me in the comment section how _YOU_ are organized, I’m really interested.**"
[React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) have been introduced in React 16.8.
"There are some prebuilt hooks (`[useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)` and `[useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)` are probably the most prominent ones), that **can be easily used in hooks built in a custom way for projects**, and a custom hook is just another function that might reuse existing hooks."
"This `useStateWithDouble` hook returns not only the value itself and a function to set it, but also the doubled value, which could then be easily used in a React component."
"There is no real limit on what can be done within such a custom hook, it is also possible to mix many different calls to the `useState`, `useEffect`, and all the other hooks, a custom hook can even reuse another custom hook."
Another thing I like is the idea of the `useEffect` hook (although I think hooks are not absolutely necessary for that idea).
Previously [lifecycle methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class) had to be used instead.
"if a component that counts the elapsed seconds was developed, then a `setInterval` was started when the component mounted and `clearInterval` was called when the component was unmounted."
This is exactly what the `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` functions in the code below are doing.
"The code for the interval is split among these two lifecycle functions, which is already bad enough, but it gets even worse when there is more than one piece of code that needs a setup like this because then the `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` functions do not follow the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) anymore."
The same code can be implemented a lot cleaner using the `useEffect` hook.
"This way the code that belongs together also is also colocated in the source, like the `setInterval` and `clearInterval` calls in the code below."
"There are workarounds for some of these issues, but they **make some concepts hard to explain**, and in my opinion, this is a sign that not everything is solved in the best possible way, and that there might be some underlying issues."
"Sure, there are some issues with classes in JavaScript, the most prominent example is the [**binding of**](https://web.dev/javascript-this/) `[**this**](https://web.dev/javascript-this/)`**, which sometimes behaves differently than in other object-oriented languages**."
"But using [class properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties) worked quite well, so this is not really an argument for me."
"But most importantly, this decision **broke a very important invariant of functions, namely that a function will return the same value if the same input parameters are passed**."
The main reason for that is the `useState` hook.
"Whenever the `button` has to be rerendered, the function is executed again."
"`useState` introduces some side effects, something that has been frowned upon, especially in functional programming, because it makes hunting bugs harder."
So **I think that stuff having an internal state should be modeled using classes and objects instead of functions.**
"Additionally, there are many hooks like `useState`, `useRef`, or `useMemo` that seem to replicate the behavior that would be quite easy to be implemented in classes, which makes this decision even less understandable for me."
"Another issue is that hooks avoid the `this` keyword, but introduce another problem called staleness."
"The issue is that the `seconds` variable in the `useEffect` hook will always be taken from the first render, where `seconds` was set to `0` because this is [how closures work](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)."
"Therefore the `setSeconds` called every second will always calculate `0 + 1` and assign 1 to the state, causing the seconds to hang from an end-user perspective."
"This issue can be fixed by passing a function to `setSeconds`, which will retrieve the current value as an argument."
"So the problem with `this` was fixed by replacing it with another one; instead of having to know how classes and the `this` keyword work, developers have to know how closures work, and they can lead to even sneakier bugs in my opinion."
"If `this` is accidentally bound to a wrong value for whatever reason, then there will be an error in the developer console."
"the `useState` hook is a bit weird (probably even the React team themselves, since [they devoted an own section in the documentation for it](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#tip-what-do-square-brackets-mean))."
The `useState` call in the above code makes use of array destructuring.
"When the function is re-executed, the `useState` hook will return a different value for `count`, but in a new function execution."
"Therefore the `count` variable can have a different value on each execution, although it is defined as `const`."
**This decision has been made to allow the variables however you wish because they are assigned by their position.** The `useState` hook itself does not name that at all.
"**The below code might be more verbose, but I think it is easier to understand what is happening.**"
"Even though `useEffect` is probably my favorite hook, it has still a rather strange syntax, which makes it not that easy to explain."
"The old lifecycle functions had their fair share of problems, for which reason I think it is a step forward, **but having methods on a class called** `**componentDidMount**`**,** `**componentWillUmount**`**, etc."
"Another thing that bothers me is that the `useEffect` hook is always taken as an example of why hooks are better than classes, but I think that is mixing two different things."
"**The idea of effects is great, but they should be seen decoupled from hooks.** I think effects could have also been implemented using classes in one or the other way."
"The other thing is that some hooks force developers to generate even more code, which might cause performance to be worse, even for hooks like `useMemo` and `useCallback` that are actually made for improving performance."
"Dodds has written another blog post about this.](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback) **The main takeaway is that when using** `**useCallback**` **or** `**useMemo**` **there is already another function call and array definition, and the performance win has to outweigh this additional work.**"
"When developing classes this is more or less already solved, at least apart from a few possible confusing scenarios regarding the `this` keyword."
"Summed up I can agree with the fact, that there are some advantages with hooks, especially with `useEffect`."
"But especially the `useEffect` hook could probably also be implemented using classes, at least in theory."
"These thoughts are coming off the top of my head, if you agree/disagree or have other issues with hooks please let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=https://danielrotter.at/2022/01/16/some-reasons-for-disliking-react-hooks.html)!"

It’s called **the professional yell**.
US Money says it is the [#1 sign you have a bad boss](http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/09/05/10-signs-you-have-a-bad-boss).
"In his forthright biography, _Steve Jobs_, Isaac Walterson said Jobs’ “nasty edge was not necessary”:"
"At the time of writing this, my social media networks are fraught with clips and stories of [violent riots](http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/27/us/baltimore-unrest/index.html) in Baltimore."
"Ray Lewis, Baltimore Ravens’ gargantuan linebacker, posted a video on his [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/officialraylewis) and within 8 hours reached well-over 15.5 million views."
"It was a [video](https://www.facebook.com/officialraylewis/videos/10153320592515701) of him yelling at the rioters to get off the streets of Baltimore, the city he loves so passionately."
"Morag Barrett, the CEO of [SkyeTeam](http://skyeteam.com/team/morag-barrett/), a leadership development company, [said](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/13/steve-jobs-yelled-at-tim-cook-a-few-times_n_6864734.html), “Raising your voice at the right level and the right time is the skill of a great leader.”"
"At its core, it takes a good amount of **self-awareness.** Do not begin professionally yelling until you _first_ have the ability to take a third-person view of yourself, assessing your own temperament, as well your impact on others around you."
**The professional yell is vision-based**.
"**The professional yell is emotional, but not out of control**."
**The professional yell is not personal**.
"_Ad hominem_ is latin for “to the man” or “to the person.” Meaning, you are more focused on insulting the character of the other person than on solving the problem."
"The [One Minute Manager](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688014291/?), a quick read used by millions of managers in Fortune 500 companies and small businesses nationwide, talked about the three most critical conversations a manager can have with an employee:"

"**One Minute Praisings**: Catching someone doing something right, and recognizing them for it."
"**One Minute Reprimands**: Catching unproductive or negative behavior immediately, and explaining to the employee what the consequences have been."
"**\[Warning: this is going to get extremely practical.** There are other ways of finding team members, but this is one way I have found that works.\]"
Buy a domain (I use [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)) for your idea and set up a landing page using a simple website builder (I use [Instapage)](http://instapg.es/cdPs7) and pitch your idea as you would if you were trying to make real sales or get downloads from the public customer.
Build the landing page with an email capture [call-to-action](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/02/20/call-to-action-buttons) at the bottom.
"Once you build a landing page, and it looks great (Read: [How to make a great landing page with crazy high conversions](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/12/great-landing-pages)), share on your social networks."
"Also, use [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), “the front page of the Internet” social news website, especially the subreddits [/r/entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/) and [/r/startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/)."
Reddit has been an incredible source of objective feedback and traffic for [many startups](http://opportunitylives.com/college-startup-seeks-to-revolutionize-1-5-billion-peanut-butter-industry/).
"Also, write a post on [Medium](https://medium.com/), an emerging publishing platform for new ideas."
Experiment more with your landing page (this is called [A/B testing](https://vwo.com/ab-testing/)).
"Then, set up a free [Slack](https://slack.com/) community."
"Within Slack, [set up channels](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201402297-Creating-a-channel) where you can focus conversations and brainstorm on specific topics such as #Design, #Marketing, and #Development."
"But seeing that [working remotely is becoming more and more the working norm](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324539404578342503214110478), I am a lot better off than building a business idea secretively inside my own head."
