"The issue is that the `seconds` variable in the `useEffect` hook will always be taken from the first render, where `seconds` was set to `0` because this is [how closures work](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).","The issue is that the seconds variable in the useEffect hook will always be taken from the first render, where seconds was set to 0 because this is how closures work.","The issue is that the seconds variable in the useEffect hook will always be taken from the first render, where seconds were set to 0 because this is how closures work."
