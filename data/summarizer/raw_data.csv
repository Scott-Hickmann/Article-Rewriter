One is a major blowup that triggers a Russian ultimatum to Zelensky.

Neutralize the threat of Ukraine joining NATO anytime soon\n2.  Maintain control over the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbas\n3.  Weaken NATO over the long run by proving its limitations\n4.  Demonstrate America’s inability to act to actually defend allies\n5.  Pull Ukraine into Russia’s orbit permanently""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""For all NATO’s bluster about being more united than ever and a paltry few American combat troops dispatched to feign real commitment, it is clear that Putin has already achieved 3 and 4.

Even if an insurgency doesn’t kill hundreds of Russian soldiers, eventually Ukraine will be free again.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""Because this truth runs up against objective 5, all-out conquest is the least likely outcome. Putin is more cautious than people give him credit for and Russia’s newly-professional military is as casualty averse and reliant on firepower as America’s — moving in after a collapse of the Kyiv government is a distinct possibility, but it is doubtful an invasion will be the tool to bring this about except in the last resort.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""A substantial military defeat in Ukraine’s east, however, would prove both NATO’s unwillingness to assist and Zelensky’s inability to protect his people. A limited operation opens the door to further conquest through non-military means.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""Troop deployments aside, Putin does not want to conquer Ukraine by force. Having to do this would represent a partial failure of his own strategy and probably lead to a united European Union response which will be worse for Russia than a united NATO.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""The Transatlantic Alliance will always be hindered by [America’s ongoing collapse](https://medium.com/gen/fourth-america-is-almost-over-americans-want-a-divorce-9367a5d50df7), a process Russia can now actively intensify if it chooses — and might, as part of Putin’s ultimate revenge for the fall of the Soviet Union.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""Were I in his position, that would be my ultimate goal.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""But objectives 1 and 2 are paramount for Putin. Everything he has done to get NATO and America in a tizzy has been designed to prove one thing to Ukraine: you are alone.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""And Ukraine is. America is running away just like it did in Afghanistan, Biden entirely concerned about his domestic audience and pitiful chances at re-election in 2024. A classic politician who cares only for his own interests, Biden cannot be trusted and is as much an accelerator of America’s demise at this point as Trump.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""Putin’s maskirovka is designed to obscure his core aims. Objective 5 is on his horizon, but Putin is savvy enough to realize he doesn’t get it if there’s an all-out war.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""Instead, after a sufficient provocation now or this summer, Russia can simply sit back and bombard Ukraine for days or weeks with weapons Ukraine can’t stop. A direct invasion of Ukraine at any point will follow an initial campaign intended to paralyze and crush Ukraine’s armed forces in the east because in all warfare the core requirement is to defeat you enemy’s military, not capture their cities.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""So the likely course of events if war breaks out soon goes like this:""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""*   Russia makes several moves that keep a door open to negotiations and imply a willingness to back down\n*   An accident or intentional attack kills Russian soldiers or Russian-speakers in Ukraine\n*   Putin gives Zelensky an ultimatum, threatening a total invasion if he doesn’t accede to Russian demands\n*   If Zelensky resists, separatists in Donbas begin making advances backed by Russian artillery and air strikes.\n*   Putin denies an invasion is underway even as Ukraine’s forces are smashed from the air. If sanctions drop, he escalates by striking more of Ukraine’s military infrastructures. If Ukraine negotiates, the attacks stop.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""At this point it’s on America to go ahead with its sanctions threat while Russia insists it’s not invading anyone, just supporting people under attack. The major attack I fear could involve chemical weapons in order to directly call into question American assertions of Russian responsibility and remind the world of the lies that got America into Iraq.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""If major fighting begins, it continues until Zelensky agrees to terms or falls to a coup after Ukraine’s military is decimated. Russia’s forces surrounding Ukraine give Putin options he can elect to deploy one at a time or all at once.""},{""type"":""paragraph"",""text"":""Maskirovka, like all Russian military doctrine, is based on the Soviet experiences in the Second World War.

This is a long-term shift in Russia’s positions intended to communicate that Russia trusts China and potential conflicts in Europe and Asia will always be linked.\n\nI seriously doubt any conflict in Ukraine begins with a sudden massive Russian attack —the bluff this could happen has been useful making London and Washington panic but doesn’t match up with Putin’s domestic rhetoric. What he needs to justify an attack is an outburst of violence like what appears to be now escalating in Donbas.\n\nThat, of course, is why American and British media have been [hyping the danger of a false-flag attack](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/us-intelligence-russia-false-flag/index.html). The problem with them doing this is that by definition false-flag operations are difficult to attribute with any certainty — if an attack comes, everyone will believe what they want to.\n\nMy fear is that Wagner-affiliated mercenaries are plotting a major attack with chemical weapons somewhere in Donbas that will take place before the end of February. Both American and [Russian sources](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-us-mercenaries-plan-chemical-attack-ukraine/) weeks ago hinted at the other side launching some kind of chemical weapons attack, which is classic in false-flag operations.\n\nWhen one is launched, no one will be sure who actually did it for some time. It took months of direct inspections to prove [Syria used chemical weapons in Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_chemical_weapons_in_the_Syrian_civil_war), and many key facts are still afflicted by public doubt.\n\nPeople on both sides will believe what their leaders and media insist is true — the old saying about the first casualty of war being the truth sticks around for a reason. Just like Americans are fighting with each other over what actually happened in the Capitol Attack, so will the pundits in America and Russia insist the other side is telling lies.\n\nThere are now two basic possibilities for how the Ukraine crisis ends. One is a major blowup that triggers a Russian ultimatum to Zelensky. This will force Ukraine to choose between unfair negotiations that force cession of Donbas and Crimea permanently or a huge war Ukraine cannot win without massive direct military support Biden has already ruled out in an idiotic, counterproductive self-own.\n\nMy hope is that [Germany convinces Putin](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/scholz-flies-moscow-bid-avert-war-2022-02-15/) that it will prevent Ukraine from joining NATO through setting clear conditions on membership Kyiv is unlikely to be able to meet for twenty years. Autonomy for Donbas and an understanding that Crimea will remain Russian plus an effective demilitarized zone buffering the two sides along their mutual borders are also sadly going to be necessary to avert a war.\n\nThe conflict has to be settled for a generation — and I suspect it will be this year, one way or another. Now that Ukraine stands alone Putin can keep ratcheting up pressure on Kyiv until he gets what he wants or Zelensky falls, creating an opening for a coup and sudden deployment of military forces at the invitation of the new regime.\n\nPutin’s objectives in this crisis ranked according to importance are:\n\n1.  Neutralize the threat of Ukraine joining NATO anytime soon\n2.  Maintain control over the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbas\n3.  Weaken NATO over the long run by proving its limitations\n4.  Demonstrate America’s inability to act to actually defend allies\n5.  Pull Ukraine into Russia’s orbit permanently\n\nFor all NATO’s bluster about being more united than ever and a paltry few American combat troops dispatched to feign real commitment, it is clear that Putin has already achieved 3 and 4. In the face of direct military threats to a partner that could harm American citizens, Biden is backing down as fast as he can while trying to refocus America’s attention on China.\n\nSo now Putin aims to resolve 1 and 2. He would clearly prefer to win through negotiation, but it is apparent that he is committed to victory even at serious cost to Russia’s international reputation and long-term relationship with Ukraine.\n\nThe real deterrent to a major invasion is the fact that, contrary to his own insistence that Russians and Ukrainians will always be the same people, a big war will permanently sever whatever bonds remain. Even if an insurgency doesn’t kill hundreds of Russian soldiers, eventually Ukraine will be free again.\n\nBecause this truth runs up against objective 5, all-out conquest is the least likely outcome. Putin is more cautious than people give him credit for and Russia’s newly-professional military is as casualty averse and reliant on firepower as America’s — moving in after a collapse of the Kyiv government is a distinct possibility, but it is doubtful an invasion will be the tool to bring this about except in the last resort.\n\nA substantial military defeat in Ukraine’s east, however, would prove both NATO’s unwillingness to assist and Zelensky’s inability to protect his people. A limited operation opens the door to further conquest through non-military means.\n\nTroop deployments aside, Putin does not want to conquer Ukraine by force. Having to do this would represent a partial failure of his own strategy and probably lead to a united European Union response which will be worse for Russia than a united NATO.\n\nThe Transatlantic Alliance will always be hindered by [America’s ongoing collapse](https://medium.com/gen/fourth-america-is-almost-over-americans-want-a-divorce-9367a5d50df7), a process Russia can now actively intensify if it chooses — and might, as part of Putin’s ultimate revenge for the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nWere I in his position, that would be my ultimate goal.\n\nBut objectives 1 and 2 are paramount for Putin. Everything he has done to get NATO and America in a tizzy has been designed to prove one thing to Ukraine: you are alone.\n\nAnd Ukraine is. America is running away just like it did in Afghanistan, Biden entirely concerned about his domestic audience and pitiful chances at re-election in 2024. A classic politician who cares only for his own interests, Biden cannot be trusted and is as much an accelerator of America’s demise at this point as Trump.\n\nPutin’s maskirovka is designed to obscure his core aims. Objective 5 is on his horizon, but Putin is savvy enough to realize he doesn’t get it if there’s an all-out war.\n\nInstead, after a sufficient provocation now or this summer, Russia can simply sit back and bombard Ukraine for days or weeks with weapons Ukraine can’t stop. A direct invasion of Ukraine at any point will follow an initial campaign intended to paralyze and crush Ukraine’s armed forces in the east because in all warfare the core requirement is to defeat you enemy’s military, not capture their cities.\n\nSo the likely course of events if war breaks out soon goes like this:\n\n*   Russia makes several moves that keep a door open to negotiations and imply a willingness to back down\n*   An accident or intentional attack kills Russian soldiers or Russian-speakers in Ukraine\n*   Putin gives Zelensky an ultimatum, threatening a total invasion if he doesn’t accede to Russian demands\n*   If Zelensky resists, separatists in Donbas begin making advances backed by Russian artillery and air strikes.\n*   Putin denies an invasion is underway even as Ukraine’s forces are smashed from the air. If sanctions drop, he escalates by striking more of Ukraine’s military infrastructures. If Ukraine negotiates, the attacks stop.\n\nAt this point it’s on America to go ahead with its sanctions threat while Russia insists it’s not invading anyone, just supporting people under attack. The major attack I fear could involve chemical weapons in order to directly call into question American assertions of Russian responsibility and remind the world of the lies that got America into Iraq.\n\nIf major fighting begins, it continues until Zelensky agrees to terms or falls to a coup after Ukraine’s military is decimated. Russia’s forces surrounding Ukraine give Putin options he can elect to deploy one at a time or all at once.\n\nMaskirovka, like all Russian military doctrine, is based on the Soviet experiences in the Second World War. Russia doesn’t see war like the definition-obsessed Americans do — it isn’t something declared, waged, then ended.\n\nWar is politics, and politics is war — Russia has learned Clausewitz’ lesson better than anyone. All conflict takes place on a continuum and each move made is part of a deeper, multi-layered game. Violence is merely a tool, deployed as needed to prove a point.\n\nI hope, hope, hope a conflict can still be averted. But America’s strategy has failed and is probably making everything worse.\n\nIn the long run, only Europe will ever defend Ukraine. Only Europe can deal with Russia. American leaders are too ignorant of geography, history, and systems to be trusted in this crisis.""}"

They dismissed warnings about a harsh winter as “doomsaying.” Soviet idiots forced their version of “normal,” along with their grain quotas and productivity expectations, down Ukraine’s throat, then sat back and judged them for the fallout.\n\nHistory explains why all these wishful thinkers and positivity nuts piss us off so much when they pop up to accuse us of pessimism and negative thinking. As the record shows, dictators and their propaganda machines use positive thinking as a weapon to neutralize criticism. They drag it out to alleviate themselves from accountability.\n\nThat’s why we’re so skeptical of it.\n\nThings are bad right now.\n\nThey’re bad because a handful of wealthy, elite assholes are working us to death. They’re strip mining the world for its last little bit of resources. They’re forcing everyone to produce more than they can, and it’s leading to a worldwide murder by starvation.\n\nThe oligarchs don’t just live in Russia. They’re everywhere. Likewise, the poor people don’t just live in places like Sudan or Afghanistan, where parents are now selling their own children for food. They’re everywhere, too. You just have to know where to look. These places that fragile suburbanites describe as “dangerous,” are really just the pockets of crime and poverty our economic system has created, and knowingly maintains.\n\nCapitalism profits from despair.\n\nIt engineers trauma.\n\n# There’s more than one apocalypse.\n\nThe apocalypse isn’t some catastrophe that happens suddenly. It’s happening right in front of us, slowly, with plenty of chances to stop it.\n\nUkraine understands this.\n\nThey’ve **_been_** through an apocalypse. It’s not so far back in their history. Every year, while Americans celebrate Thanksgiving with football and urgent shopping, Ukraine observes _Holodomor_, a time when a brutal dictator starved them. That’s why they’re fighting like hell for freedom. They’re not going to let someone else put them through that ever again.\n\nThis struggle is going on everywhere.\n\nUkraine is a country of heroes right now. They’re the ones standing up to a bully and an abuser. Anyone who’s ever been bullied or abused knows that once you’re free, you’ll do anything to avoid going back. We know that the apocalypse isn’t some Hollywood script. It’s the kind of pain and suffering that doesn’t make for good entertainment. It’s the kind of atrocities that we’re tempted to overlook and wish away.\n\nIt has happened before.\n\nCall it the apocalypse. Call it armageddon. Call it WWIII. Call it whatever you want. It’s happening right now. Everywhere we look, the rich and powerful are abusing us and destroying our homes through all kinds of injustices, many of them environmental, and irreversible.\n\nIt’s not that hard to stop any of this.\n\nThe best news is that by saving ourselves, by learning to survive and be happy with less, by practicing sustainability, and demanding it from our leaders, by refusing to accept “normal,” we are also **_saving the world._**\n\nIt just takes a little courage.""}"

It seems clear that the conflict is not going to die down quickly, with the Ukrainian President understandably and bravely unwilling to leave his people or go down without a fight. And then of course, there’s the arguably even more alarming, absolutely bizarre fact that Russia has also [now threatened military action](https://twitter.com/femi_sorry/status/1497217148267253760?s=21) against Sweden and Finland as well.\n\nNaturally people are going to look for leadership, levelheadedness, and guidance during these times. Someone who approaches the situation with clarity, and is able to convey a message that makes people feel not only heard, but understood.\n\nLeave it to Bernie Sanders to be that leader.\n\nOn Twitter, captioning a five minute video of a speech in which he delved into detail sharing his thoughts about the Russian war against Ukraine, Bernie [said](https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1497028266967945217?s=20&t=QvH9qD5v4yQA0ggZWdOm9g):\n\n> “Putin and his oligarch friends seek a divided world and the destruction of democracy. We must stand with the Ukrainian people against this war, and with the Russian people who are demonstrating against their corrupt, reckless president who started it.”\n\nBernie is absolutely correct.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, there are certainly years of context and the United States and NATO do not have clean hands in what led up to this conflict. But there is also absolutely no denying that this was a clearly premeditated, long sought after conflict that’s been a part of Putin’s imperialistic ambitions for _years_. That said, I do not want the United States putting boots on the ground, or doing anything that could potentially make this worse than it already is. As Bernie’s statement implies, there is no side to take in this conflict other than with the Ukrainian people, and those in Russia who are protesting a war they do not want to see happening.\n\nIt’s impossible not to appreciate the fact that Bernie took the time to remind people that we must stand with the Russian people as well. Leave it to the Senator from Vermont to remind us now more than ever, we need solidarity among the masses. It’s incredible to see images of Russians brave enough to take a stand no matter the consequences, and rising up against the regime.\n\nAnd of course, I know I’m not alone in appreciating the strength of the Ukrainian resistance. Personally, I have not been able to stop thinking about the Ukrainian woman who was filmed approaching a Russian soldier, offered sunflower seeds, and said:\n\n> “Take these seeds and put them in your pockets so at least sunflowers will grow when you all lie down here…”\n\nSunflowers are the national flower of Ukraine.\n\nIn a single sentence, that woman managed the capture the entire essence of her country’s resistance and their fight for their sovereignty.\n\nAs we watch all of this take place and wonder what’s going to happen next, it’s hard not to feel helpless. But, as Bernie reminds us, there is power in solidarity. It’s hard not to hear him speak at times like this, and appreciate his leadership.\n\n_If you would like to donate and support my writing, it is so appreciated and you can do so through my_ [_ko-fi account_](https://ko-fi.com/xlauren_mx).""}"

Three key things.\n\n| ![Zeroing in on the branding (2013)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Ryu8xQJ-6KRjP73jZe4HWg.png) |\n|:--:|\n| *Zeroing in on the branding (2013)* |\n\n## It Looks Different\n\nTo get attention in a crowded market, we had to find a way to get people’s attention. Most enterprise software looks like a cheap 70's prom suit — muted blues and greys everywhere — so, starting with the logo, we made Slack look like a confetti cannon had gone off. Electric blue, yellows, purples, and greens all over. We gave it the color scheme of a video game, not an enterprise collaboration product.\n\n**Here’s** [**HipChat**](http://www.hipchat.com) **next to Slack:**\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Eyy-KRgOtGcOnaAIJPV28Q.png)\n\nWhich would you rather use? They both do exactly the same thing, but one feels dull and the other feels electric and playful. The difference? Vibrant colors, a curvy sans-serif typeface, friendly icons, and smiling faces and emojis everywhere.\n\n## It Feels Different\n\nSlack is also chock full of fun little interactions. The logo animates in a burst of colors as it loads; modals slide down from the top of the screen; changing teams flips the screen around like a deck of cards. Throughout the entire product, everything seems to playfully jump around and pop off the screen. Each of these interactions is designed not only to help the user understand what’s going on, but put a little smile on their face.\n\n> “We gave it the color scheme of a video game,not an enterprise collaboration product.”\n\nHave you ever walked into a house and had an indescribable feeling that it just feels cheap? A professional builder would walk in and give you a laundry list of shortcomings: uneven drywall, gappy hardwood floors, hollow-core doors, and cheap hardware. But most people just have a gut reaction. Like a well-built home, great software focuses on giving its users hundreds of small, satisfying interactions. A great transition in a mobile app gives us the same feeling we get from using a well-made door handle on a solid oak door — you may not be able to put your finger on it, but man, does the house ever feel well built. Slack is really fun to use. It feels like a well-built house.\n\n## It Sounds Different\n\nBut it’s not just how Slack looks and feels, it’s also about what it says. In Slack, every piece of copy is seen as an opportunity to be playful. Where a competitor might just have a loading spinner, Slack has funny quotes like, “Need to whip up a dessert in a hurry? Dump a bag of oreos on the floor and eat the oreos off the floor like an animal.” A strange little injection of fun into an otherwise boring day. Slack acts like your wise-cracking robot sidekick, instead of the boring enterprise chat tool it would otherwise be. Like _Interstellar’s_ TARS, compared to _2001: A Space Odyssey’s_ HAL9000:\n\n**Slack:**\n\n> TARS: Everybody good? Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?\n\n**Their competitors:**\n\n> HAL9000: I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I’ve still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission.\n\nEven [Slack’s Twitter account](https://twitter.com/slackhq) sounds more like an emoji-loving comedian than a billion dollar enterprise software company:\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*WdSRsXcnlyeo2tZSApwYIQ.png)\n\nWe humans have a tendancy to anthropomorphize just about everything, from our pets to inanimate objects. We think cars look like they are smiling, or that a lamp “looks lonely over there”. With Slack, a bubbly, bright UI, delightful interactions, and hilarious copywriting come together to create a personality. A personality which has triggered something powerful in its users: they care about it. They want to share it with others. It feels like a favorite co-worker, not a tool or utility.\n\n> “Slack acts like your wise-cracking robot sidekick, instead of the boring enterprise chat tool it would otherwise be.”\n\nAs a kid, I used to love this burger chain called [White Spot](http://www.whitespot.ca). It started out as a tiny shack at a baseball stadium and over the past 85 years it has grown into a huge chain with locations all over Canada. The secret to its success? The “Triple-O” secret sauce that they put on all their burgers.\n\nI used to bug my parents to let us go to White Spot instead of having another gross lovingly home-cooked meal. That is, until my Dad dropped a bomb on me. “We should just make burgers at home,” he said “you know that sauce is just mayonnaise, ketchup, and a bit of relish, right?” Sure enough, we made it at home, and confirmed that their so-called secret sauce was a bunch of grocery store condiments mixed together. Anyone could make it, but few people knew how or bothered. Instead they chalked it up to a some crazy secret recipe.\n\nSlack’s secret sauce is no different. Sure, it’s hard to get the mix of ingredients just right, but it doesn’t have any features that Hipchat and Campfire can’t build. It’s the same enterprise chat client underneath, but it’s playful, fun to use, and all that comes together to make it feel like a character in your life. It’s TARS, not HAL9000.\n\nOver the past couple months, their competitors have caught on. They’ve all started using casual copy and trying to bone up on design, but it’s a little like your uncle trying to do the macarena. It’s too little too late. Everyone has picked their robot sidekick. Slack has stolen the show.\n\n_Andrew runs_ [_MetaLab_](http://metalab.co/?utm_source=Medium&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=Slack%20Post)_.

She never [returned](http://allthingsd.com/20130206/amazons-executive-team-is-shrinking/).\n\nIn 2013, during my second year at Amazon, I had a baby of my own. Six weeks after my daughter was born, I was diagnosed with cancer. I was given detailed instructions by my oncologist’s staff on how to “pump and dump” my breast milk for 24 hours to prevent my daughter from ingesting radioactive matter. There I was, soothing my infant, unsure of whether or not I would be around to see her first birthday.\n\nAfter my surgery, while I was still on maternity leave, I received a form letter saying that the health insurance provided by my employer had been terminated. Dozens of panicked emails and phone calls later, the whole thing was, I was told, a glitch in the system. After a week of back and forth, I was offered COBRA coverage, by which point I had already switched to my husband’s insurance, where I remained for the duration of my care. I chalked it up to a horrendous administrative error but remain disappointed that a company of Amazon’s size didn’t have better mechanisms in place to prevent something like that from happening during an employee’s maternity leave.\n\nAfter a five-month leave, I was nervous and excited to return to work, and I showed up that first day back with a big smile and a phone full of baby pictures to share. I figured I’d catch up with folks and get a high-level update on how the business was doing, since the strategy had evolved from the time I was hired. Here’s what happened instead: I was taken to lunch by a woman I barely knew. Over Cobb salad she calmly explained that all but one of my direct reports — the people I had hired — were now reporting to her. In the months that followed, I was placed on a dubious performance improvement plan, or PIP, a signal at Amazon that your employment is at risk. Not long after that I resigned.\n\nThe truth is, I’ve moved on. I’m healthy. I have a great job doing work I love. There’s no question Amazon is an incredible company. I met some of the strongest, most brilliant women of my career there. Unfortunately, many of those women have left. And the [voices](https://medium.com/@nickciubotariu/an-amazonian-s-response-to-inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace-b06ca4f6d53a) commenting on the _New York Times_ piece so far have been predominantly male leaders of male-dominated teams.\n\nJeff: You asked for direct feedback. Women power your retail engine. They buy diapers. They buy books. They buy socks for their husbands on Prime. On behalf of all the people who want to speak up but can’t: Please, make Amazon a more hospitable place for women and parents. Reevaluate your parental leave policies. You can’t claim to be a data-driven company and not release more specific [numbers](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-more-diverse-at-its-warehouses-than-among-white-collar-ranks/) on how many women and people of color apply, get hired and promoted, and stay on as employees. In the absence of meaningful public data — especially retention data — all we have are stories. This is mine.""}"

[**Steal like an artist**](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2.html#rule-7-steal-like-an-artist)\n\nLet’s get to it.\n\n# Rule 1: Light Comes From the Sky\n\n_Shadows are invaluable cues in telling the human brain what user interface elements we’re looking at._\n\nThis is perhaps the **most important non-obvious thing** to learn about UI design: _light comes from the sky._ Light comes from the sky so frequently and consistently that for it to come from below actually looks _freaky._\n\nWhen light comes from the sky, it illuminates the tops of things and casts shadows below them. The tops of stuff are lighter, the bottoms are darker.\n\nWell, the same is true for UI. Just as we have little shadows on all the undersides of all our facial features, there are shadows on the undersides of _tons_ of UI elements. **Our screens are flat, but we’ve invested a great amount of art into making so many elements on them _appear be 3-D_**.\n\n| ![My favorite part of this image is the poker finger in the lower-right.](https://miro.medium.com/max/956/1*FbusHycLlFPn1Hv1N88fzg.png) |\n|:--:|\n| *My favorite part of this image is the poker finger in the lower-right.* |\n\nTake buttons. Even with this relatively “flat” button, there are still a handful of light-related details:\n\n1.  The unpushed button (top) has a **darkened bottom edge**. Sun don’t shine there, son.\n2.  The unpushed button is **slightly brighter at the top** than at the bottom. This is because it imitates a slightly curved surface. Just as how you’d need to tilt a mirror held in front of you up to see the sun in it, surfaces that are tilted up reflect a _biiiiit_ more of the sun’s light towards you.\n3.  The unpushed button casts a **subtle shadow** – perhaps easier to see in the magnified section.\n\nThat was just a button, and yet there are these 4 little light effects present. That’s the lesson here. Now we just apply it to _everything._\n\n| ![iOS 6 is old news, but it makes a good case study in light behavior.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*4FCAIgmJa8BuildjlnsDeA.png) |\n|:--:|\n| *iOS 6 is old news, but it makes a good case study in light behavior.* |\n\nHere is a pair of old iOS 6 settings — “Do Not Disturb” and “Notifications”. Look how many light effects are going on with them.\n\n*   The top lip of the inset control panel casts a small shadow\n*   The “ON” slider track is also immediately set in a bit\n*   The “ON” slider track is concave and the bottom reflects more light\n*   The icons are set _out_ a bit. See the bright border around the top of them? This represents a surface perpendicular to the light source, hence receiving a lot of light, hence bouncing a lot of light into your eyes.\n*   The divider notch is shadowed where angled away from the sun and vice versa\n\nNow that you know, you’ll notice it everywhere. You’re welcome, kid.\n\n# Rule 2: Black and White First\n\n_Designing in grayscale before adding color simplifies the most complex element of visual design– and forces you to focus on spacing and laying out elements._\n\nUX designers are really into designing “mobile-first” these days. That means you think about how pages and interactions work on a phone _before_ imagining them on your zillion-pixel $6000 pro monitor.\n\nAnd **that sort of constraint is great. It clarifies thinking**. You start with the harder problem (usable app on a teeny-weeny screen), then adopt the solution to the easier problem (usable app on a large screen).\n\nWell here’s another similar constraint: design _black and white first_. Start with the harder problem of making the app beautiful and usable in every way, but without the aid of color. **Add color last, and even then, only with purpose**.\n\n| ![[Haraldur Thorleifsson](http://ueno.co/)’s grayscale wireframes look as good as lesser designer’s finished sites.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*qheNNhQhjjwxMeJ5XGocsA.png) |\n|:--:|\n| *[Haraldur Thorleifsson](http://ueno.co/)’s grayscale wireframes look as good as lesser designer’s finished sites.* |\n\nThis is a reliable and easy way to keep apps looking “clean” and “simple”. **Having too many colors in too many places is a really easy way to screw up clean/simple**. B&WF forces you to focus on things like spacing, sizes, and layout first. And those are the primary concerns of a clean and simple design.\n\n## Step 2: How to add color\n\nThe simplest color to add is one color.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*YxV7C-nHHir-PSbJ4-jqhQ.png)\n\nAdding one color to a grayscale site draws the eye simply and effectively.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pds21170RP-6ZIkuSxgI2Q.png)\n\nYou can also take it one step up. Grayscale + _two_ colors, or grayscale + multiple colors of a single hue.\n\n> Color codes in practice — i.e. wait, what’s a hue?The web by and large talks about color as RGB hex codes. It’s most useful to ignore those. RGB is not a good framework for coloring designs. Much more useful is HSB (which is synonymous with HSV, and similar to HSL).HSB is better than RGB because it fits with the way we think about color naturally, and you can predict how changes to the HSB values will affect the color you’re looking at.If this is news to you, here’s a good primer on HSB colors.\n\n| ![Single-hue gold theme from [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/08/color-theory-for-designer-part-3-creating-your-own-color-palettes/).](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*tZRxO2DReDduBqOwgqd_yw.jpeg) |\n|:--:|\n| *Single-hue gold theme from [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/08/color-theory-for-designer-part-3-creating-your-own-color-palettes/).* |\n\n| ![Single-hue blue theme from [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/08/color-theory-for-designer-part-3-creating-your-own-color-palettes/).](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*-rbrbh20EHL_Ue_IDxl_0A.jpeg) |\n|:--:|\n| *Single-hue blue theme from [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/08/color-theory-for-designer-part-3-creating-your-own-color-palettes/).* |\n\nBy modifying the **saturation** and **brightness** of a single hue, you can generate multiple colors— darks, lights, backgrounds, accents, eye-catchers— but it’s not overwhelming on the eye.\n\nUsing multiple colors from one or two base hues is the **most reliable way to accentuate and neutralize elements without making the design messy**.\n\n| ![Countdown timer by [Kerem Suer](https://dribbble.com/kerem)](https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*_fM8VVYx7hMgdJ_Wy24AXg.png) |\n|:--:|\n| *Countdown timer by [Kerem Suer](https://dribbble.com/kerem)* |\n\nIn my experience, adjusting your theme color to fit the use-cases your UI calls for is the _most important skill_ in using color, and I’ve written a practical guide to it [here](https://learnui.design/blog/color-in-ui-design-a-practical-framework.html).\n\n## A few other notes on color\n\nColor is the most complicated area of visual design. And while a lot of stuff on color is obtuse and not practical for finishing the design in front of you, I’ve seen some really good stuff out there.\n\n*   [**Learn UI Design**](http://learnui.design/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=7-rules-part-1). Shameless plug: this is a course I’ve created, and it contains 3 _hours_ of video about designing with color (and over 20 hours of total videos on UI design topics). Check it out at [_learnui.design_](http://learnui.design/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=7-rules-part-1).\n*   [**Color in UI Design: A (Practical) Framework**](https://learnui.design/blog/color-in-ui-design-a-practical-framework.html). If you liked this section, but want to hear more about _color_ (as opposed to just black and white), this is your article. And guess who wrote it!\n*   [**Accessible Color Generator**](https://learnui.design/tools/accessible-color-generator.html). A handy tool for taking one color (your theme color, logo color, etc) and turning it into a whole, accessible color palette.\n*   [**Dribbble search-by-color**](https://dribbble.com/colors/BADA55)**.** Another awesome way to find what works with a particular color. Talk about practical. If you already have one color decided, come look at what the world’s best designers are doing/matching with that color.\n\n# Rule 3: Double your whitespace\n\n_To make UI that looks designed, add a lot of breathing room._\n\nIn Rule 2, I said that B&WF forces designers to think about _spacing and layout_ before considering color, and how that’s a good thing. Well, it’s time we talk about spacing and layout.\n\nIf you’ve coded HTML from scratch, you’re probably familiar with the way HTML is, by default, laid out on the page.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*fS6ixQIk88MJlEmph7PeJA.png)\n\nBasically, everything is smashed towards the top of the screen. The fonts are small; there’s absolutely no space between lines. There’s a _biiit_ of space between paragraphs, but it isn’t much. The paragraphs just stretch on to the end of the page, whether that’s 100 px or 10,000 px.\n\nAesthetically speaking, that’s _awful_. **If you want to make UI that looks _designed_, you need to add in a lot of breathing room**.\n\nSometimes a ridiculous amount.\n\nHere’s an illustrative music player concept by [Piotr Kwiatkowski](https://dribbble.com/p_kwiatkowski).\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*qFwXZ_05pRv2OtiaJHIp6Q.jpeg)\n\nPay particular attention to the menu on the left.\n\n| ![Left menu](https://miro.medium.com/max/660/1*jSC64LYfVYlMHaI_B7xfKQ.png) |\n|:--:|\n| *Left menu* |\n\nThe vertical space between the menu items is fully _twice_ the height of the text itself. You’re looking at 12px font with just as much padding above and below it.\n\nOr take a look at the list titles. **There’s a 15px space between the word “PLAYLISTS” and its own underline. That’s more than the** [**cap height**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_height) **of the font itself!** And that’s to say nothing of the 25 pixels between the lists.\n\n| ![_More space in the top nav bar. The text “Search all music” is 20% of the height of the bar. The icons are similarly proportioned._](https://miro.medium.com/max/666/1*43qoikq5esyOer2PpETX_Q.png) |\n|:--:|\n| *_More space in the top nav bar. The text “Search all music” is 20% of the height of the bar. The icons are similarly proportioned._* |\n\nThe left sidebar shows generous spacing in between lines of text, and more.\n\nPiotr was conscientious about putting in extra space here, and it paid off. While this is just a concept he put together for the fun of it (as far as I know), as far as aesthetics go, it’s beautiful enough to compete with the best music UIs out there.\n\nGood, generous whitespace can make some of the messiest interfaces look inviting and simple.\n\nPut space between your lines.\n\nPut space between your elements.\n\nPut space between your groups of elements.\n\n**Analyze what works**.\n\n_OK, that wraps up Part 1. Thanks for sticking around!_\n\nIn [Part 2](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2.html), I’ll be talking about the last 4 rules:\n\n> 4. Learn the methods of overlaying text on images5. Make text pop— and un-pop6. Only use good fonts7. Steal like an artist\n\nIf you learned something useful in Part 1, [read Part 2](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-2.html).\n\n# Still can’t get enough? Introducing… Learn UI Design\n\nI’ve been plugging away to create the **single most comprehensive** online video course for learning the **practical skills of interface design**.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*ih8R489EfuZb58WMR2x8Zg.png)\n\nLearn UI Design covers all kinds of topics:\n\n*   **Color**. Picking good colors, adjusting them for different purposes in your interface, developing a palette, fixing clashing colors, and more.\n*   **Typography**. Choosing fonts, styling text, pairing fonts, and more.\n*   **Fundamentals of design**. Spacing, alignment, grids, layout, lighting, shadows, and more.\n*   **User interface elements.** Form controls (like buttons and text boxes), icons, imagery (like photography and illustrations), tables and lists (hugely important for mobile app design), and more.\n\nHere’s an idea of how much content there is. The topics you’ve already heard about — lighting, use of gray, and spacing — each have their _own_ videos, totaling **1 hr, 52 min**.\n\nThere is a _ton_ of content in this course: **20+ hours of video** in **40+ video lessons**.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bptkBKJtVrx5-yO0-ePJWQ.png)\n\nIn almost every video, you’ll _watch me design in Sketch_. This is important. I’m not teaching some theoretical framework here. Instead, everything I show you is the tips, tricks, and frameworks I use to design interfaces every day. Think of it as watching over my shoulder as I teach you everything I know.\n\nFor example, in the “Gray” video (yes: 27 minutes _all about using a single color_), I start by showing you a practical technique to make your grays match your theme colors, no matter what those colors are. Then I do another demo to show off gray’s versatility, explaining ways in which its _subtlety_ is actually a _strength_. This includes some tips that took me _years_ to notice.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3hmtgx-9aY4YA18fnVYUDA.png)\n\nFinally, I explain why gray is the classiest color, and used by so many luxury and fashion brands. Then I explain the homework for the lesson and wrap up. By the end, we’ve done 3 live demos, explained a few key tricks for how to add gray to your designs, and looked at 10 well-designed real-world examples (including 1 designed by me).\n\nHere’s what folks are saying about Learn UI Design:\n\n> “Learn UI Design is like learning how to fly a plane by actually sitting in the cockpit with the pilot — Erik is constantly designing/redesigning real-world examples right in front of you, explaining why X is good or bad, and how to go about making it even better.” — Mudassir Ali, Frontend Engineer, Canva“Learn UI Design’s straightforward approach, illustrated with real-life examples and tutorials, was extremely helpful and eye-opening. I would highly recommend this course for UX designers wanting to add UI design to their toolkit.” — Sarah Kim, UX Design Lead“Erik’s pragmatic approach to design has taught me infinitely more than what reading any design books ever did! Away with the books, and one more video please.” — Anders Nysom, Freelance Developer\n\nIf you’re a dev, UX designer, or PM, and want to add visual design to your skillset, this course is tailor-made for you.

The slides look great. But we’re not telling a compelling story. Can you help?”\n\nOne of my favorite things is helping leadership teams craft a better strategic story— for fundraising, sales, recruiting, whatever. I was busy with other projects and couldn’t start immediately, so I sent a link to the man on the CMO’s team who built the deck — a guy named Zack.\n\nFive days later, the CMO texted me:\n\n“Andy, what did you send Zack? Because his deck got a lot better. Kind of like night and day.”\n\n# What I Sent Zack\n\nWhat I sent Zack was a link to Elon Musk’s presentation for the Tesla Powerwall (the full video is at the bottom of this post). I also included a version of the points I’ll share below.\n\nMusk’s delivery isn’t stellar. He’s self-conscious and fidgety. But at the end, his audience cheers. _For a battery._\n\nThat’s because Musk does five things right that you should emulate in _every_ pitch you _ever_ make to _anybody._ And you should do them in this order:\n\n# #1: Name the enemy\n\n| ![Musk’s villain: fossil fuels](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ap5uyOu3xPSHAB8eRStVrQ.jpeg) |\n|:--:|\n| *Musk’s villain: fossil fuels* |\n\nNever start a pitch by talking about yourself, your team, your product, or your total addressable market. Instead, _start by naming the thing that’s getting in the way of your customer’s happiness._ Do that by painting an emotionally resonant picture of how your customer is struggling, who/what is to blame, and why. When Musk shows this image of burning fossil fuels, you can practically hear Darth Vader’s ominous breath.\n\n# #2: Answer “Why now?”\n\n| ![The Keeling Curve: growth of atmospheric CO2 concentration](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*6ombB6XMmaNtFKFXW-zPlA.jpeg) |\n|:--:|\n| *The Keeling Curve: growth of atmospheric CO2 concentration* |\n\nAudiences — particularly investors — are skeptical.

But when an audience knows where you’re headed, they’re much more likely to buckle in for the ride.\n\n# #4: Identify obstacles—then explain how you’ll overcome them\n\nNow that you’ve shared your vision of the future, (a) lay out the obstacles to achieving it and (b) show how your company/product/service will overcome each one. (There had better be some big, nasty obstacles — otherwise who needs what you’re selling?)\n\nMusk addresses three obstacles to a solar-powered world:\n\n(i) The amount of energy produced by solar panels varies throughout the day and night (thus the need for batteries):\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*U2o87KxJwCinJAvvZAR1cw.jpeg)\n\n(ii) Most people think the land area required for batteries to store enough energy to rid U.S. of fossil fuels would be really huge (but according to Musk, it’s that tiny red dot in Texas):\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*X2ZQIpaRlPueygrZaC06iQ.jpeg)\n\n(iii) Musk says that currently available batteries “suck” in seven specific ways:\n\n| ![Current battery technology: not ready for your living room](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*zJaYD7l7KWZIjQGNpYpnWg.jpeg) |\n|:--:|\n| *Current battery technology: not ready for your living room* |\n\nBy this point, Musk’s audience is practically salivating for the Powerwall product video, which will explain how Powerwall does _not_ suck in each of those seven ways.

All words; short ones, cool ones. All you had to do was ask. It didn’t even cost anything to claim. This grand opportunity was true for years. In 1994 a _Wired_ writer noticed that mcdonalds.com was still unclaimed, so with our encouragement he registered it, and then tried to give it to McDonalds, but their cluelessness about the internet was so hilarious it became [a _Wired_ story](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/mcdonalds_pr.html). Shortly before that I noticed that abc.com was not claimed so when I gave a consulting presentation to the top-floor ABC executives about the future of digital I told them that they should get their smartest geek down in the basement to register their own domain name. They didn’t.\n\nThe internet was a wide open frontier then. It was easy to be the first in category X. Consumers had few expectations, and the barriers were extremely low. Start a search engine! An online store! Serve up amateur videos! Of course, that was then. Looking back now it seems as if waves of settlers have since bulldozed and developed every possible venue, leaving only the most difficult and gnarly specks for today’s newcomers. Thirty years later the internet feels saturated, bloated, overstuffed with apps, platforms, devices, and more than enough content to demand our attention for the next million years. Even if you could manage to squeeze in another tiny innovation, who would notice it?\n\nYet if we consider what we have gained online in the last 30 years, this abundance smells almost miraculous. We got: Instant connection with our friends and family anywhere, a customizable stream of news whenever we want it, zoomable 3D maps of most cities of the world, an encyclopedia we can query with spoken words, movies we can watch on a flat slab in our pocket, a virtual everything store that will deliver next day — to name only six out of thousands that could be mentioned.\n\nBut, but…here is the thing. In terms of the internet, nothing has happened yet. The internet is still at the beginning of its beginning. If we could climb into a time machine and journey 30 years into the future, and from that vantage look back to today, we’d realize that most of the greatest products running the lives of citizens in 2044 were not invented until after 2014. People in the future will look at their holodecks, and wearable virtual reality contact lenses, and downloadable avatars, and AI interfaces, and say, oh, you didn’t really have the internet (or whatever they’ll call it) back then.\n\nAnd they’d be right. Because from our perspective now, the greatest online things of the first half of this century are all before us. All these miraculous inventions are waiting for that crazy, no-one-told-me-it-was-impossible visionary to start grabbing the low-hanging fruit — the equivalent of the dot com names of 1984.\n\nBecause here is the other thing the greybeards in 2044 will tell you: Can you imagine how awesome it would have been to be an entrepreneur in 2014?

Expectations and barriers were low. It was easy to be the first. And then they would sigh, “Oh, if only we realized how possible everything was back then!”\n\nSo, the truth: Right now, today, in 2014 is the best time to start something on the internet. There has never been a better time in the whole history of the world to invent something. There has never been a better time with more opportunities, more openings, lower barriers, higher benefit/risk ratios, better returns, greater upside, than now. Right now, this minute. This is the time that folks in the future will look back at and say, “Oh to have been alive and well back then!”\n\nThe last 30 years has created a marvelous starting point, a solid platform to build truly great things. However the coolest stuff has not been invented yet — although this new greatness will not be more of the same-same that exists today. It will not be merely “better,” it will different, beyond, and other. But you knew that.\n\nWhat you may not have realized is that today truly is a wide open frontier.

Let alone chapters. Chapters often have page after page of paragraphs. It just seems such an awful lot of words to concentrate on, on their own, without something else happening. And once you’ve finished one chapter, you have to get through another one. And usually a whole bunch more, before you can say _finished_, and get to the next. The next book. The next thing. The next possibility. Next next next.\n\n# I am an optimist\n\nStill, I am an optimist. Most nights last year, I got into bed with a book — paper or e — and started. Reading. Read. Ing. One word after the next. A sentence. Two sentences.\n\nMaybe three.\n\nAnd then … I needed just a _little_ something else. Something to tide me over. Something to scratch that little itch at the back of my mind— just a quick look at email on my iPhone; to write, and erase, a response to a funny Tweet from William Gibson; to find, and follow, a link to a good, really good, article in the _New Yorker_, or, better, the _New York Review of Books_ (which I might even read most of, if it is that good). Email again, just to be sure.\n\nI’d read another sentence. That’s four sentences.\n\n> Smokers who are the most optimistic about their ability to resist temptation are the most likely to relapse four months later, and overoptimistic dieters are the least likely to lose weight. (Kelly McGonigal: The Willpower Instinct)\n\nIt takes a long time to read a book at four sentences per day.\n\nAnd it’s exhausting. I was usually asleep halfway through sentence number five.\n\nI’ve noticed this pattern of behaviour for a while now, but I think last year’s completed book tally was as low as it has ever been. It was dispiriting, most deeply so because my professional life revolves around books: I started [LibriVox](http://librivox.org) (free public domain audiobooks), and [Pressbooks](http://pressbooks.com) (an online platform for making print and ebooks), and I co-edited a [book about the future of books.](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Futurists-Manifesto-Collection-Publishing/dp/1449305601)\n\nI’ve dedicated my life one way or another to books, I _believe_ in them, yet, I wasn’t able to read them.\n\nI’m not alone.\n\n# When the people at the New Yorker can’t concentrate long enough to listen to a song all the way through, how are books to survive?\n\nI heard an interview on the [New Yorker podcast recently](https://soundcloud.com/newyorker/teju-cole-talks-about-red-and-his-career#t=5:35), the host was interviewing writer and photographer, Teju Cole.\n\n> Host:One of the challenges in culture now is to, say, listen to a song all the way through, we’re all so distracted, are you still able to kind of give deep attention to things, are you able to sort of engage in culture that way?”Teju Cole:“Yes, very much so.”\n\nWhen I heard this, I felt like hugging the host. He couldn’t even listen to a song all the way through, before getting distracted. Imagine what his bedside pile of books does to him.\n\nI also felt like hugging Teju Cole. It’s people like Mr. Cole who give us hope that someone will be left to teach our children how to read books.\n\n# Dancing to distraction\n\nWhat was true of my problems reading books — the unavoidable siren call of the digital hit of new information — was true in the rest of my life as well.\n\nMy two-year old daughter, dance recital. Pink tutu. Cat ears on her head. Along with five other two-year-olds, in front of a crowd of 75 parents and grandparents, these little toddlers put on a show. You can imagine the rest. You’ve seen these videos on Youtube, maybe I have shown you my videos. The cuteness level was extreme, a moment that defines a certain kind of parental pride. My daughter didn’t even dance, she just wandered around the stage, looking at the audience with eyes as wide as a two-year old’s eyes starting at a bunch of strangers. It didn’t matter that she didn’t dance, I was so proud. I took photos, and video, with my phone.\n\nAnd, just in case, I checked my email. Twitter. You never know.\n\nI find myself in these kinds of situations often, checking email or Twitter, or Facebook, with nothing to gain except the stress of a work-related message that I can’t answer right now in any case.\n\nIt makes me feel vaguely dirty, reading my phone with my daughter doing something wonderful right next to me, like I’m sneaking a cigarette.\n\nOr a crack pipe.\n\nOne time I was reading on my phone while my older daughter, the four-year-old, was trying to talk to me. I didn’t quite hear what she had said, and in any case, I was reading an article about North Korea. She grabbed my face in her two hands, pulled me towards her. “Look at me,” she said, “when I’m talking to you.”\n\nShe is right. I should.\n\nSpending time with friends, or family, I often feel a soul-deep throb coming from that perfectly engineered wafer of stainless steel and glass and rare earth metals in my pocket. _Touch me. Look at me. You might find something marvellous._\n\nThis sickness is not limited to when I am trying to read, or once-in-a-lifetime events with my daughter.\n\nAt work, my concentration is constantly broken: finishing writing an article (this one, actually), answering that client’s request, reviewing and commenting on the new designs, cleaning up the copy on the About page. Contacting so and so. Taxes.\n\nAll these tasks critical to my livelihood, get bumped more often than I should admit by a quick look at Twitter (for work), or Facebook (also for work), or an article about [Mandelbrot sets](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/weekend-diversion-zooming-into-a-fractal-975c80636cf0) (which, just this minute, I read).\n\nEmail, of course, is the worst, because email is where work happens, and even if it’s not the _work you should be doing right now_ it may well be work that’s easier to do than what you are doing now, and that means somehow you end up doing that work instead of whatever you are supposed to be working on now. And only then do you get back to what you should have been focusing on all along.\n\n# Dopamine and digital\n\nIt turns out that digital devices and software are finely tuned to train us to pay attention to them, no matter what else we should be doing. The mechanism, borne out by recent neuroscience studies, is something like this:\n\n*   _New information creates a rush of dopamine to the brain, a neurotransmitter that makes you feel good._\n*   _The promise of new information compels your brain to seek out that dopamine rush._\n\nWith fMRIs, you can see the brain’s pleasure centres light up with activity when new emails arrive.\n\nSo, every new email you get gives you a little flood of dopamine. Every little flood of dopamine reinforces your brain’s memory that checking email gives a flood of dopamine. And our brains are programmed to seek out things that will give us little floods of dopamine. Further, these patterns of behaviour start creating neural pathways, so that they become unconscious habits: Work on something important, brain itch, check email, _dopamine_, refresh, _dopamine_, check Twitter, _dopamine_, back to work. Over and over, and each time the habit becomes more ingrained in the actual structures of our brains.\n\nHow can books compete?\n\n# Pleasing ourselves to death\n\nThere is a famous study of rats, wired up with electrodes on their brains. When the rats press a lever, a little charge gets released in part of their brain that stimulates dopamine release. A pleasure lever.\n\nGiven a choice between food and dopamine, they’ll take the dopamine, often up to the point of exhaustion and starvation. They’ll take the dopamine over sex. Some studies see the rats pressing the dopamine lever 700 times in an hour.\n\nWe do the same things with our email. Refresh. Refresh.\n\n| ![[**Choices: Part 1 (xkcd)**](https://xkcd.com/264/)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*94zfTpRx5rN12Y53Y3covw.jpeg) |\n|:--:|\n| *[**Choices: Part 1 (xkcd)**](https://xkcd.com/264/)* |\n\nThere is no beautiful universe on the other side of the email refresh button, and yet it’s the call of that button that keeps pulling me out of the work I am doing, out of reading books I want to read.\n\n# Why are books important?\n\nWhen I think back on my life, I can define a set of books that shaped me — intellectually, emotionally, spiritually. Books have always been an escape, a learning experience, a saviour, but beyond this, greater than this, certain books became, over time, a kind of glue that holds together my understanding of the world. I think of them as nodes of knowledge and emotion, nodes that knot together the fabric my self. Books, for me anyway, hold together who I am.\n\nBooks, in ways that are different to visual art, to music, to radio, to love even, force us to walk through another’s thoughts, one word at a time, over hours and days. We share our minds for that time with the writer’s. There is a slowness, a forced reflection required by the medium that is unique. Books recreate someone else’s thoughts inside our own minds, and maybe it is this one-to-one mapping of someone else’s words, on their own, without external stimuli, that give books their power. Books force us to let someone else’s thoughts inhabit our minds completely.\n\nBooks are not just transferrers of knowledge and emotion, but a special kind of tool that flattens one self into another, that enable the trying-on of foreign ideas and emotions.\n\nThis suppressing of the self is a kind of meditation too — and while books have always been important to me on their own (pre-digital) merits, it started to occur to me that “learning how to read books again,” might also be a way to start weaning my mind away from this dopamine-soaked digital detritus, this meaningless wash of digital information, which would have a double benefit: I would be reading books again, and I would get my mind back.\n\nAnd, there are, often, beautiful universes to be found on the other side of the cover of a book.\n\n# The problems with digital stuff\n\nRecent neuroscience confirms many of the things we sufferers of digital overload know innately. That successful multi-tasking is a myth. Multi-tasking makes us stupider. According to psychologist Glenn Wilson, the cognitive losses from multitasking are equivalent to smoking pot. _(UPDATE: thanks to_ [_Liza Daly_](https://medium.com/@liza) _for pointing out that Glenn Wilson has publicly stated that this study was part of a paid PR gig, and misrepresented in the media. See:_ [_http://www.drglennwilson.com/Infomania\\_experiment\\_for\\_HP.doc_](http://www.drglennwilson.com/Infomania_experiment_for_HP.doc)_)_\n\nThis is bad for so many reasons: it makes us less effective at work, which means either we get less done, or have less time to spend doing other things, or both.\n\n> Being in a situation where you are trying to concentrate on a task, and an e-mail is sitting unread in your inbox, can reduce your effective IQ by 10 points. (The Organized Mind, by Daniel J Levitin)\n\nIt’s worse than that though, because this constant hopping from one thing to another is also exhausting.\n\nMy least productive days, the days when I have spent the most time jumping between projects and emails and Twitter and whatever else, are also my most exhausting days. I used to think that my exhaustion was the cause of this lack of focus, but it turns out the opposite might be true.\n\n> It takes more energy to shift your attention from task to task. It takes less energy to focus. That means that people who organize their time in a way that allows them to focus are not only going to get more done, but they’ll be less tired and less neurochemically depleted after doing it. (The Organized Mind, by Daniel J Levitin)\n\n# The problem defined\n\nAnd so, the problem, more or less, is identified:\n\n1.  I cannot read books because my brain has been trained to want a constant hit of dopamine, which a digital interruption will provide\n2.  This digital dopamine addiction means I have trouble focusing: on books, work, family and friends\n\nProblem identified, or most of it. There is more.\n\n# Oh, and don’t forget about television\n\nWe live in a golden age of television, there is no doubt. The stuff being produced these days is very good. And there is a lot of it.\n\nFor the past couple of years, my evening routine has been a variation on: get home from work, exhausted. Make sure the girls have eaten. Make sure I eat. Get the girls to bed. Feel exhausted. Turn on the computer to watch some (neo-golden-age-era) television. Fiddle with work emails, and generally piddle around while that golden-age-era TV consumes 57% of my attention. Be bad at watching TV and bad at getting emails done. Go to bed. Try to read. Check email. Try to read again. Fall asleep.\n\n> Those who read own the world, and those who watch television lose it. (Werner Herzog)\n\nI don’t know if Werner Herzog is right, but I do know that I would never say about television — even the great stuff, of which there is plenty — what I say about books. There are no television shows that exist as nodes holding together my understanding of the world. My relationship to television is just not the same as it is to books.\n\n# And, so, a change\n\nAnd so, starting in January, I started making some changes. The key ones are:\n\n1.  No more Twitter, Facebook, or article reading during the work day (hard)\n2.  No reading of random news articles (hard)\n3.  No smartphones or computers in the bedroom (easy)\n4.  No TV after dinner (it turns out, easy)\n5.  Instead, go straight to bed and start reading a book — usually on an eink ereader (it turns out, easy)\n\nThe shocking thing was how quickly my mind adapted to accommodate reading books again. I had expected to fight for that concentration — but I didn’t have to fight. With less digital input (no pre-bed TV, especially), extra time (no TV, again), and without a tempting digital device near at hand … there was time and space for my mind to settle into a book.\n\nWhat a wonderful feeling it was.\n\nI am reading books now more than I have in years. I have more energy, and more focus than I’ve had for ages. I have not fully conquered my digital dopamine addiction, though, but it’s getting there. I think reading books is helping me retrain my mind for focus.\n\nAnd books, it turns out, are still the same wonderful things they used to be. I can read them again.\n\nWorkday email, however, remains a problem. If you have suggestions for that, please let me know.\n\n_(By the way, I am starting a little email newsletter about books, reading and the technology that surrounds them both.

The shape of a sword with polished edges and a razor sharp blade that will cut you in half if you are not equally hardened.\n\n# 2 :: Because You Care What Others Think About You\n\nBecause you have to fit in.\n\nBecause you believe that being different is only cool if you’re different in the same way that other people are different.\n\nBecause you are afraid to embrace your true self for fear of how the world will see you. You think that because you judge others, this means that those people must, in-turn, be judging you.\n\nBecause you care more about the stuff you have as opposed to the things you’ve done.\n\nBecause while you’re out spending your money on new outfits, new cars, overpriced meals or nights at the bar, I’ll be investing in myself. And while you try to fit in with the world I’ll make the world fit in with me.\n\n> Because I will recklessly abandon all insecurities and expose my true self to the world. I will become immune to the impact of your opinion and stand naked in a crowd of ideas; comfortable in knowing that while you married the mundane I explored the exceptional.\n\n# 3 :: Because You Think You Are Smarter Than You Are\n\nBecause you did what everyone else did; you studied what they studied and read what they read.\n\nBecause you learned what you had to learn in order to pass _their_ tests and you think that makes you smart.\n\nBecause you think learning is only something people do in schools.\n\nBecause while you were away at college, I was studying life; because instead of learning about the world in a classroom I went out and learned it by living.\n\nBecause I know more than any piece of paper you could ever frame from a university. Because smart is not what you learn, it’s how you live.\n\nBecause I might not have a degree but I challenge you to find a topic that I can’t talk to you about cohesively.\n\nBecause I could pass your tests if I had to, but you couldn’t stand for a single second in the face of the tests that life has thrown me. Tests that are not graded on a bell curve or by percentages; tests that are graded by one simple stipulation: survival!\n\n# 4 :: Because You Don’t Read\n\nBecause you read the things you are required to read or nothing at all.\n\nBecause you think history is boring and philosophy is stupid.\n\nBecause you would rather sit and watch “E!” or “MTV” instead of exploring something new, instead of diving head first, into the brain of another man in an attempt to better understand the world around you.\n\nBecause you refuse to acknowledge that all the power in the world comes from the words of those that lived before us. That anything you desire can be had by searching through the multitude of words that are available to us now more abundantly than ever before.\n\nBecause you are probably not reading this article even though you know you should.\n\nBecause the people that are reading this already know these things.\n\nBecause you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink.\n\n# 5 :: Because You Lack Curiosity\n\nBecause you get your news from copy-cat members of the state-controlled media.\n\nBecause you are unwilling to ask this simple question… “What if it’s all a lie?”, and accept the possibility that maybe it is; that just maybe, the methods of mass media are under direct orders to: keep you distracted.\n\nBecause you call me a know-it-all but refuse to call yourself a know-nothing-at-all.\n\nBecause I thirst for knowledge, regardless the topic.\n\nBecause while you’re busy playing _Candy Crush_, or _Megalopolis,_ I am reading about string theory and quantum mechanics.\n\nBecause while you waste your time with Tosh.o I am learning how to edit video, build websites and design mobile apps.\n\nBecause if we were to go heads-up in a debate, I would crush you. I would make it a point to defeat my own argument; from every imaginable angle; in order to understand everything you might be able to use against me.\n\nBecause I would dedicate myself to understanding both sides of the argument so thoroughly that I could argue your side for you and win; even after having just handed you a defeat in the same debate.\n\n# 6 :: Because You Don’t Ask Enough Questions\n\nBecause you do not question authority.\n\nBecause you don’t question yourself.\n\nBecause you don’t understand the power of properly placed questioning in life, respectful disagreements and standing up for what you know to be right in the face of someone telling you otherwise. Unable to question reality; stuck in a self imposed survival strategy within a matrix-style monotony.\n\nBecause I know that you will give me all the information I need to destroy you by letting you talk.\n\nBecause I study human behaviors and you ignore everyone but yourself.\n\nBecause I watch how you say the things you say just as closely as I listen to what you say; and you say way too much!\n\nBecause control comes, not from spewing your ignorance like some incurable case of logorrhea, but from properly structuring the context of your questions.\n\nBecause I study the premise of your argument and destroy it from the ground level before you even get a chance to establish your ideas.\n\n# 7 :: Because You Can’t Handle The Truth\n\nBecause you refuse to admit that you don’t even know the things you don’t know.\n\nBecause there isn’t an article online that would make up for all the time you have wasted in life.\n\nBecause even if I told you everything could be different tomorrow you would wait until then to begin doing anything about it.\n\nBecause even when you think I’m not, I’m aware of my surroundings.\n\nBecause you think that since I have not acknowledged you, it means that I have not seen you.\n\nBecause, you walk around with your head up your ass, oblivious to the world around you. Blissfully ignorant of the reality that sits so close to your face that if you stuck your tongue out, just once, you would taste it and realize how delicious the truth actually is.\n\nBecause you would become an instant addict. Unable to pull yourself from the teat of truth. Finally able to understand your lack of understanding, and then you would see; then you would know that the only thing holding you back from doing something truly amazing, is you.\n\n> Want to help me do something truly amazing? click here""}"

I opened my laptop and posted to my new blog. This, though, was the first time in six years. And it nearly broke my heart.\n\nA few weeks earlier, I’d been abruptly pardoned and freed from Evin prison in northern Tehran. I had been expecting to spend most of my life in those cells: In November 2008, I’d been sentenced to nearly 20 years in jail, mostly for things I’d written on my blog.\n\nBut the moment, when it came, was unexpected. I smoked a cigarette in the kitchen with one of my fellow inmates, and came back to the room I shared with a dozen other men. We were sharing a cup of tea when the voice of the floor announcer — another prisoner — filled all the rooms and corridors. In his flat voice, he announced in Persian: “Dear fellow inmates, the bird of luck has once again sat on one fellow inmate’s shoulders. Mr. Hossein Derakhshan, as of this moment, you are free.”\n\n**That evening was** the first time that I went out of those doors as a free man. Everything felt new: The chill autumn breeze, the traffic noise from a nearby bridge, the smell, the colors of the city I had lived in for most of my life.\n\n## For more on hacking check out this:\n\nAround me, I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I’d been used to. An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with. New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs. Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you.\n\nTwo weeks later, I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. I called it [_Ketabkhan_](http://blogs.tarjomaan.com/books/) — it means book-reader in Persian.\n\nSix years was a long time to be in jail, but it’s an entire era online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but _reading_ — or, at least, getting things read — had altered dramatically. I’d been told how essential social networks had become while I’d been gone, and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now.\n\nSo I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn’t care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. No description. No image. Nothing. It got three likes. Three! That was it.\n\nIt became clear to me, right there, that things had changed. I was not equipped to play on this new turf — all my investment and effort had burned up. I was devastated.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*u4hzdMWeNiyfUWb3O83hQg.png)\n\n![B](https://miro.medium.com/max/150/1*W5V3Agjhs4GaZd-PuEZA_w.png)B**logs were gold** and bloggers were rock stars back in 2008 when I was arrested. At that point, and despite the fact the state was blocking access to [my blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20081030105806/http://i.hoder.com/) from inside Iran, I had an audience of around 20,000 people every day. Everybody I linked to would face a sudden and serious jump in traffic: I could empower or embarrass anyone I wanted.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*waJ4KKsRlF-nNwJVmlUxPA.jpeg)\n\nPeople used to carefully read my posts and leave lots of relevant comments, and even many of those who strongly disagreed with me still came to read. Other blogs linked to mine to discuss what I was saying. I felt like a king.\n\nThe iPhone was a little over a year old by then, but smartphones were still mostly used to make phone calls and send short messages, handle emails, and surf the web. There were no real apps, certainly not how we think of them today. There was no Instagram, no SnapChat, no Viber, no WhatsApp.\n\nInstead, there was the web, and on the web, there were blogs: the best place to find alternative thoughts, news and analysis. They were my life.\n\n**It had all** started with 9/11. I was in Toronto, and my father had just arrived from Tehran for a visit. We were having breakfast when the second plane hit the World Trade Center. I was puzzled and confused and, looking for insights and explanations, I came across blogs. Once I read a few, I thought: This is it, I should start one, and encourage all Iranians to start blogging as well. So, using Notepad on Windows, I started experimenting. Soon I ended up writing on [hoder.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20020613100521/http://hoder.com/i/default.asp), using Blogger’s publishing platform before Google bought it.\n\nThen, on November 5, 2001, I published [a step-to-step guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20030401200358/http://i.hoder.com/index.php?sec=guide) on how to start a blog. That sparked something that was later called a [blogging revolution](http://www.amazon.com/Blogistan-Internet-Politics-International-Library/dp/1845116070): Soon, hundreds and thousands of Iranians made it one of the top 5 nations by the number of blogs, and I was proud to have a role in this unprecedented democratization of writing.\n\nThose days, I used to keep [a list of all blogs in Persian](https://web.archive.org/web/20020802005944/http://hoder.com/i/links.asp) and, for a while, I was the first person any new blogger in Iran would contact, so they could get on the list. That’s why they called me “[the blogfather](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hoder/1878402927/)” in my mid-twenties — it was a silly nickname, but at least it hinted at how much I cared.\n\nEvery morning, from my small apartment in downtown Toronto, I opened my computer and took care of the new blogs, helping them gain exposure and audience. It was a diverse crowd — from exiled authors and journalists, female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans — and I always encouraged even more. I invited more religious, and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, people who lived inside Iran, to join and start writing.\n\nThe breadth of what was available those days amazed us all. It was partly why I promoted blogging so seriously. I’d left Iran in late 2000 to experience living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the rapidly emerging trends at home. But reading [Iranian blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogging_in_Iran) in Toronto was the closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random passengers.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*u4hzdMWeNiyfUWb3O83hQg.png)\n\n![T](https://miro.medium.com/max/152/1*ip87iQg84Rf_IIqtt35mLg.png)T**here’s a story** in the Quran that I thought about a lot during my first eight months in solitary confinement. In it, a group of persecuted Christians find refuge in a cave. They, and a dog they have with them, fall into a deep sleep. They wake up under the impression that they’ve taken a nap: In fact, it’s 300 years later. One version of the story tells of how one of them goes out to buy food — and I can only imagine how hungry they must’ve been after 300 years — and discovers that his money is obsolete now, a museum item. That’s when he realizes how long they have actually been absent.\n\nThe hyperlink was my currency six years ago. Stemming from the idea of the [hypertext](http://www.cyberartsweb.org/cpace/ht/htov.html), the hyperlink provided a diversity and decentralisation that the real world lacked. The hyperlink represented the open, interconnected spirit of the world wide web — a vision that started with its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee. The hyperlink was a way to abandon centralization — all the links, lines and hierarchies — and replace them with something more distributed, a system of nodes and networks.\n\nBlogs gave form to that spirit of decentralization: They were _windows_ into lives you’d rarely know much about; _bridges_ that connected different lives to each other and thereby changed them. Blogs were _cafes_ where people exchanged diverse ideas on any and every topic you could possibly be interested in. They were Tehran’s taxicabs writ large.\n\nSince I got out of jail, though, I’ve realized how much the hyperlink has been devalued, almost made obsolete.\n\nNearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any other object — the same as a photo, or a piece of text — instead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer. You’re encouraged to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting: Adding several links to a piece of text is usually not allowed. Hyperlinks are objectivized, isolated, stripped of their powers.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/476/1*tHsP5l0-QDb2DlBExw5O1A.jpeg)\n\nAt the same time, these social networks tend to treat native text and pictures — things that are directly posted to them — with a lot more respect than those that reside on outside web pages. One photographer friend explained to me how the images he uploads directly to Facebook receive a large number of likes, which in turn means they appear more on other people’s news feeds. On the other hand, when he posts a link to the same picture somewhere outside Facebook — his now-dusty blog, for instance — the images are much less visible to Facebook itself, and therefore get far fewer likes. The cycle reinforces itself.\n\nSome networks, like Twitter, treat hyperlinks a little better. Others, insecure social services, are far more paranoid. Instagram — owned by Facebook — doesn’t allow its audiences to leave whatsoever. You can put up a web address alongside your photos, but it won’t go anywhere. Lots of people start their daily online routine in these cul de sacs of social media, and their journeys end there. [Many don’t even realize](http://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/) that they’re using the Internet’s infrastructure when they like an Instagram photograph or leave a comment on a friend’s Facebook video. It’s just an app.\n\nBut hyperlinks aren’t just the skeleton of the web: They are its eyes, a path to its soul. And a blind webpage, one without hyperlinks, can’t look or gaze at another webpage — and this has serious consequences for the dynamics of power on the web.\n\nMore or less, all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power, and mostly in a negative sense: the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object, devoid of intelligence or agency. But in the world of webpages, gaze functions differently: It is more empowering. When a powerful website — say Google or Facebook — gazes at, or links to, another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it — it brings it into existence; gives it life. Metaphorically, without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe. No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it, it is actually both dead _and_ blind; and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.\n\nOn the other hand, the most powerful web pages are those that have many eyes upon them. Just like celebrities who draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing at them any given time, web pages can capture and distribute their power through hyperlinks.\n\nBut apps like Instagram are blind — or almost blind. Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards, reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others, leading them into quiet deaths. The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*u4hzdMWeNiyfUWb3O83hQg.png)\n\n![E](https://miro.medium.com/max/130/1*LSgu1LiUIzP_GBHUweQo1w.png)E**ven before I** went to jail, though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed. Its biggest enemy was [a philosophy](http://www.academia.edu/5605971/Internet_Stoning_Power_resistance_and_the_subaltern_on_web_discourses) that combined two of the most dominant, and most overrated, values of our times: novelty and popularity, reflected by the real world dominance of young celebrities. That philosophy is the Stream.\n\n[The Stream](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/2013-the-year-the-stream-crested/282202/) now dominates the way people receive information on the web. Fewer users are directly checking dedicated webpages, instead getting fed by a never-ending flow of information that’s picked for them by complex –and secretive — algorithms.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/686/1*BdpA6yCi5WUk2FLHI9mQow.jpeg)\n\nThe Stream means you don’t need to open so many websites any more. You don’t need numerous tabs. You don’t even need a web browser. You open Twitter or Facebook on your smartphone and dive deep in. The mountain has come to you. Algorithms have picked everything for you. According to what you or your friends have read or seen before, they predict what you might like to see. It feels great not to waste time in finding interesting things on so many websites.\n\nBut are we missing something here? What are we exchanging for efficiency?\n\nIn many apps, the votes we cast — the likes, the plusses, the stars, the hearts — are actually more related to cute avatars and celebrity status than to the substance of what’s posted. A most brilliant paragraph by some ordinary-looking person can be left outside the Stream, while the silly ramblings of a celebrity gain instant Internet presence.\n\nAnd not only do the algorithms behind the Stream equate newness and popularity with importance, they also tend to show us more of what we’ve already liked. These services carefully scan our behaviour and delicately tailor our news feeds with posts, pictures and videos that they think we would most likely want to see.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*yYsXBXxRugXtft91gRcNeg.jpeg)\n\nPopularity is not wrong in and of itself, but it has its own perils. In a free-market economy, low-quality goods with the wrong prices are doomed to failure. Nobody gets upset when a quiet Brooklyn cafe with bad lattes and rude servers goes out of business. But opinions are not the same as material goods or services. They won’t disappear if they are unpopular or even bad. In fact, history has proven that most big ideas (and many bad ones) have been quite unpopular for a long time, and their marginal status has only strengthened them. Minority views are radicalized when they can’t be expressed and recognized.\n\nToday the Stream is digital media’s dominant form of organizing information. It’s in every social network and mobile application. Since I gained my freedom, everywhere I turn I see the Stream. I guess it won’t be too long before we see news websites organize their entire content based on the same principles. The prominence of the Stream today doesn’t just make vast chunks of the Internet biased against quality — it also means a deep betrayal to the diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*u4hzdMWeNiyfUWb3O83hQg.png)\n\n![T](https://miro.medium.com/max/152/1*ip87iQg84Rf_IIqtt35mLg.png)T**here’s no question** to me that the diversity of themes and opinions is less online today than it was in the past. New, different, and challenging ideas get suppressed by today’s social networks because their ranking strategies prioritize the popular and habitual. (No wonder why Apple is [hiring human editors](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/16/apple-news-app-editors-curation) for its news app.) But diversity is being reduced in other ways, and for other purposes.\n\nSome of it is visual. Yes, it is true that all my posts on Twitter and Facebook look something similar to a personal blog: They are collected in reverse-chronological order, on a specific webpage, with direct web addresses to each post. But I have very little control over how it looks like; I can’t personalize it much. My page must follow a uniform look which the designers of the social network decide for me.\n\nThe centralization of information also worries me because it makes it easier for things to disappear. After my arrest, my hosting service closed my account, because I wasn’t able to pay its monthly fee. But at least I had a backup of all my posts in a database on my own web server. (Most blogging platforms used to enable you to transfer your posts and archives to your own web space, whereas now most platforms don’t let you so.) Even if I didn’t, the Internet archive might keep a copy. But what if my account on Facebook or Twitter is shut down for any reason? Those services themselves may not die any time soon, but it would be not too difficult to imagine a day many American services shut down accounts of anyone who is from Iran, as a result of the current regime of sanctions. If that happened, I might be able to download my posts in some of them, and let’s assume the backup can be easily imported into another platform. But what about the unique web address for my social network profile? Would I be able to claim it back later, after somebody else has possessed it? Domain names switch hands, too, but managing the process is easier and more clear— especially since there is a financial relationship between you and the seller which makes it less prone to sudden and untransparent decisions.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*8SOd54ZvIEoOIUMStweGMw.jpeg)\n\nBut the scariest outcome of the centralization of information in the age of social networks is something else: It is making us all much less powerful in relation to governments and corporations.\n\nSurveillance is increasingly imposed on civilized lives, and it just gets worse as time goes by. The only way to stay outside of this vast apparatus of surveillance might be to go into a cave and sleep, even if you can’t make it 300 years.\n\nBeing watched is something we all eventually have to get used to and live with and, sadly, it has nothing to do with the country of our residence. Ironically enough, states that cooperate with Facebook and Twitter know much more about their citizens than those, like Iran, where the state has a tight grip on the Internet but does not have legal access to social media companies.\n\nWhat is more frightening than being merely watched, though, is being controlled. [When Facebook can know us better than our parents with only 150 likes](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/4/1036.full.pdf), and better than our spouses with 300 likes, the world appears quite predictable, both for governments and for businesses. And predictability means control.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*u4hzdMWeNiyfUWb3O83hQg.png)\n\n![M](https://miro.medium.com/max/172/1*1MROcmxn2SNKGZo2hzyqqA.png)M**iddle-class Iranians**, like most people in the world, are obsessed with new trends. Utility or quality of things usually comes second to their trendiness. In early 2000s writing blogs made you cool and trendy, then around 2008 Facebook came in and then Twitter. Since 2014 the hype is all about Instagram, and no one knows what is next. But the more I think about these changes, the more I realize that even all my concerns might have been misdirected. Perhaps I am worried about the wrong thing. Maybe it’s not the death of the hyperlink, or the centralization, exactly.\n\nMaybe it’s that text itself is disappearing. After all, the first visitors to the web spent their time online reading web magazines. Then came blogs, then Facebook, then Twitter. Now it’s Facebook videos and Instagram and SnapChat that most people spend their time on. There’s less and less text to read on social networks, and more and more video to watch, more and more images to look at. Are we witnessing a decline of reading on the web in favor of watching and listening?\n\nIs this trend driven by people’s changing cultural habits, or is it that people are following the new laws of social networking? I don’t know — that’s for researchers to find out — but it feels like it’s reviving old cultural wars. After all, the web started out by imitating books and for many years, it was heavily dominated by text, by hypertext. Search engines put huge value on these things, and entire companies — entire monopolies — were built off the back of them. But as the number of image scanners and digital photos and video cameras grows exponentially, this seems to be changing. Search tools are starting to add advanced image recognition algorithms; advertising money is flowing there.\n\nBut the Stream, mobile applications, and moving images: They all show a departure from a _books-internet_ toward a _television-internet_. We seem to have gone from a non-linear mode of communication — nodes and networks and links — toward a linear one, with centralization and hierarchies.\n\nThe web was not envisioned as a form of television when it was invented. But, like it or not, it is rapidly resembling TV: linear, passive, programmed and inward-looking.\n\nWhen I log on to Facebook, my personal television starts. All I need to do is to scroll: New profile pictures by friends, short bits of opinion on current affairs, links to new stories with short captions, advertising, and of course self-playing videos. I occasionally click on like or share button, read peoples’ comments or leave one, or open an article. But I remain inside Facebook, and it continues to broadcast what I might like. This is not the web I knew when I went to jail. This is not the future of the web. This future is television.\n\n**Sometimes I think** maybe I’m becoming too strict as I age. Maybe this is all a natural evolution of a technology. But I can’t close my eyes to what’s happening: A loss of intellectual power and diversity, and on the great potentials it could have for our troubled time. In the past, the web was powerful and serious enough to land me in jail. Today it feels like little more than entertainment. So much that even Iran doesn’t take some — Instagram, for instance — serious enough to block.\n\nI miss when people took time to be exposed to different opinions, and bothered to read more than a paragraph or 140 characters. I miss the days when I could write something on my own blog, publish on my own domain, without taking an equal time to promote it on numerous social networks; when nobody cared about likes and reshares.\n\nThat’s the web I remember before jail. That’s the web we have to save.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/200/1*Eokg3vUJW1RvQa9JS0Oe9g@2x.png)\n\n**_Log in to Medium and “recommend” this story.  \n_**_Follow Matter on_ [_Twitter_](http://twitter.com/readmatter) _| Like us on_ [_Facebook_](http://facebook.com/readmatter)""}"

No question about it, almost everyone who writes a book is a crappy writer.\n\nAnd this is a good thing.\n\nIt’s because the writer spent his life getting GOOD at what he was writing about. He didn’t spend his life being good at writing.\n\nHe didn’t spend his life typing. He ran a country. Or built a robot. Or discovered DNA or walked between the twin towers.\n\nHe or She DID something. Something that changed lives. Something that went from his or her head out into the real world.\n\nBut that’s ok. There are a few good books out there.\n\nI like reading billion-person books. Books, that if read widely, would change a billion lives.\n\nI like reading books where I feel my brain have an IQ orgasm. Like, I literally feel my IQ go up while reading the book.\n\nAnd, (please let me stick with this metaphor one more sentence), I might have a little brain-child that turns into my own special idea or book after reading a great book.\n\nBefore I give my list, I want to mention there are three kinds of non-fiction books: (and I’m only dealing with non-fiction. Fiction is another category).\n\n**\\- BUSINESS CARD BOOKS:**\n\nThese are books like “How to be a leader”.\n\nThey establish the author as an expert. The author then uses this book to get speaking gigs or coaching or consulting gigs.\n\nThese books usually suck. Don’t read one. But nothing wrong with writing one.\n\nIn fact, writing one might be desperately important to your career.\n\n**\\- BOOKS THAT SHOULD BE CHAPTERS:**\n\nA publisher will see an article somewhere like, “12 ways to become smarter” and say, “that should be a book”.\n\nThen the writer mistakenly says, “ok” and he has to undergo the agony of changing something that was a perfectly good 2000 word article into a 60,000 word book.\n\nThose books suck. Don’t read one. And DEFINITELY don’t write one. Unless you want to waste a year of your life. I wasted 2004–2009 doing that.\n\n**\\- BRAINGASM BOOKS**\n\nHere’s my top 10 list of braingasm books. Books that will raise your IQ between the time you start and the time you end.\n\nBy the way, there are more than 10 of these books. This is just my TOP 10. Although not really in that order. It’s hard for a small mind like mine to order these.\n\n\\[Note: I KNOW, Jeff, that I have a monthly book club. Don’t yell at me!\n\nBut this is separate. That’s 10 books A MONTH.\n\nThis is my top 10 of ALL TIME, although it might change. In fact, I know it’s going to change tomorrow. I’m reading a good book right now.\n\nSometimes it changes everyday.\\].\n\n**THE BOOKS:**\n\n**“****MASTERY****”** by Robert Greene\n\nThis book is like a curated version of 1000 biographies all under the guise, “how to become a master at what you love”.\n\n**“BOLD”** by Peter Diamondis and [Steven Kotler](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2016/08/steven-kotler/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=syndicate&utm_term=steven-kotler-tomorrow-land&utm_content=content-link&utm_campaign=entrepreneurship)\n\nBasically if you want to know the future, read this.\n\nSupplement it with “Abundance” by the same two and “Tomorrowland” by [Steven Kotler](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2016/08/steven-kotler/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=syndicate&utm_term=steven-kotler-tomorrow-land&utm_content=content-link&utm_campaign=entrepreneurship)” and even “The Rational Optimist” by Matt Ridley.\n\nI feel “Abundance” is like a sequel to “The Rational Optimist”. So I’m giving you four books with one recommendation.\n\n**“OUTLIERS”** by Malcolm Gladwell\n\nGladwell is not the first person to come up with the 10,000 hour rule. Nor is he the first person to document what it takes to become the best in the world at something.\n\nBut his stories are so great as he explains these deep concepts.\n\nHow did the Beatles become the best? Why are professional hockey players born in January, February and March?\n\nAnd so on.\n\n**“WHERE GOOD IDEAS COME FROM”** by Steven Johnson\n\nAlso add to this: “How We Got to Now” by Steven Johnson.\n\nBasically: don’t believe the myth of the lonely genius.\n\nIdeas come from a confluence of history, “the adjacent possible” specific geographic locations, etc.\n\nThe connections Johnson makes are brilliant. For instance, The Gutenberg Press (which, in itself, was invented because of improvements in sewing looms), made everyone realize they had bad vision.\n\nSo the science of lenses was created. So microscopes were eventually created. So germs were eventually discovered. So modern medical science was discovered.\n\nAnd so on. Johnson is a thinker and a linker and tells a good story.\n\n**“MAN’S SEARCH FOR MEANING”** by Victor Frankl\n\nI’m at a loss for words here. Just read it.\n\nDon’t read it for the Holocaust. Or psychological theory.\n\nRead it because when you’re about halfway through you will realize your life is no longer the same.\n\nAnd next time you get a chance to whisper in the ear of someone about to kill himself, whisper words from this book.\n\n**“BORN STANDING UP”** by Steve Martin\n\nAnd while you are at it, throw in “Bounce” by Mathew Syed, who was the UK Ping Pong champion when he was younger.\n\nI love any book where someone took their passion, documented it, and shared it with us. That’s when you can see the subleties, the hard work, the luck, the talent, the skill, all come together to form a champion.\n\nHeck, throw in, “An Astronaut’s Guide to Earth” by Commander Chris Hadfield.\n\n**“ZERO TO ONE”** by Peter Thiel\n\nThere’s a lot of business books out there. 99% of them are BS. Read this one.\n\nSo many concepts really changed my attitude about not only business but capitalism.\n\nThiel, the founder of PayPal, and first investor in Facebook, is brilliant in how he simply shares his theories on building a billion dollar business.\n\nI love his story on my podcast what exactly happened in the room when a 24 year old Mark Zuckerberg was offered $250,000,000 and refused it in two minutes.\n\n**“QUIET”** by Susan Cain\n\nProbably half the world is introverts.\n\nMaybe more. It’s not an easy life to live.\n\nI sometimes have that feeling in a room full of people, “uh-oh. I just shut down. I can’t talk anymore and there’s a lock on my mouth and this crowd threw away the key.”\n\nDo you ever get that feeling? Please? I hope you do. Let’s try to lock eyes at the party.\n\n“Quiet” shows the reader how to unlock the secret powers that probably half the world needs to unlock.\n\nAnd, please Susan Cain come on my podcast.\n\n**“ANTIFRAGILE”** by Nassim Taleb\n\nAnd throw in “The Black Swan” and “Fooled by Randomness”.\n\n“Fragile” means if you hit something might break.\n\n“Resilient” means if you hit something, it will stay the same.\n\nOn my podcast Nassim discusses “Antifragility” — building a system, even on that works for you on a personal level, where you if you harm your self in some way it becomes stronger.\n\nThat podcast changed my life\n\nHe discusses Antifragility throughout history, up to our current economic situation, and even in our personal situations.\n\n**“MINDSET”** by Carol Dweck\n\nAgain, I am fascinated by the field of mastery.\n\nNot self-improvement (eat well, sleep well, etc) but on how can you continue a path of improvement so that you can really enjoy the subtleties at a very deep level of whatever it is you love.\n\nCarol Dweck, through massive research and storytelling, shows the reader how to continue on the path of improvement and why so many people fall off that path.\n\nThese are not books I’m picking so I can look smart.

I love it here. It’s like being in Hollywood, but with less-good-looking people. You have the celebs, you have the scandals, you have the media frenzy. My friends back home are full of questions:\n\n_“Is it fun?”_\n\n_“You think I should look for a job there?”_\n\n_“How far is Vegas?”_\n\nSo, here is my experience. I hope it brings the readers closer to our little valley where we are building the future. _(Hint: About 145 different companies will be solving food transportation.)_\n\nMy day begins with a 30 minute commute to work. I take the subway. The subway system in SF is called BART, short for Bay Area Rapid _(Hahahahaa .. Hahahahaaa)_ Transit. I love BART because it is always full of surprises. E.g. yesterday, I was at the train station and bam! the train came on time.\n\nMany drive to work. Driving in SF is like a theme park ride — the cars move bumper to bumper, the terrain is alpine, and the people around you have the temper of 10-year-olds.\n\nHere is a pop-quiz — Which one’s an SF road and which one’s a roller-coaster?\n\n| ![Pick the SF road. Original photos [here](http://www.kuduweru.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kingda-ka-v7dgdfpa.jpg) and [here](https://blog.parkme.com/2013/04/02/nob-hill-parking/).](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bDkyzEGbZTLX59kp2VxP_A.png) |\n|:--:|\n| *Pick the SF road. Original photos [here](http://www.kuduweru.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/kingda-ka-v7dgdfpa.jpg) and [here](https://blog.parkme.com/2013/04/02/nob-hill-parking/).* |\n\nThose with a death wish cycle to work. It is easy to spot a cyclist. If you see a guy with one side of his jeans rolled up to the shin, he is a moron; if you see a guy on a bicycle, he is a cyclist.\n\nMy office is in a neighbourhood called SoMa, short for South of Market. Many startup offices are in SoMa. The name is a tribute to the returns that investors in these startups will see in the long run. (N.B. Padlet has since moved to the [Presidio](https://padl.et/sf) neighbourhood.)\n\nSoMa is a vibrant area with a variety of establishments like Starbucks, local coffeeshops, grab-and-go coffee kiosks, and coffee trucks. It’s a shame I don’t drink coffee. It’s not that I don’t like the beverage. I just prefer not to consume anything at temperatures that would liquify my alimentary canal.\n\nWhy is coffee in SF so hot? Are people welding metal with it? The one time I asked a barista (phrased more politely, of course), I was reproached,\n\n_“Good coffee needs to be brewed at 200°F for full flavor.”_\n\nOdd! Good bread needs to be baked at 400°F but I don’t see any bakeries selling me searing dough bricks.\n\nMy company shares its office with two other companies — [Buildzoom](http://buildzoom.com) and [Flexport](http://flexport.com). Judging from their names, Buildzoom manufactures high precision microscopes and Flexport ships fluorine to dentists in China. We all have a common investor named YC. YC is the venture capital arm of the YMCA. They invest in a lot of companies every year, many that seem outrageous on paper. E.g. they invested in a company called [Swapbox](http://swapbox.com), which, I believe, is cloud storage for swingers.\n\nNow, you must be thinking — _“Isn’t it stupid to judge a company by its name?”_ No. It’s not. Most companies in the Bay Area have obvious names:\n\n*   Evernote makes note taking apps\n*   Optimizely lets you optimize your websites\n*   Google lets you google anything on the Internet\n\nOur office, like most modern startup offices, has an open floor plan. In an open floor plan, desks are organised like tables in a college cafeteria. However, instead of food and noise, you have computers, food, and noise.\n\nThe noise mandates that you wear headphones while working. Be careful, though. Your choice of headphones reveals a lot about your character:\n\n*   **Beats headphones:** You are wasting your life’s earnings on fashion, hopelessly trying to look like a cool teenager.\n*   **Headphones that come with your phone:** You value a simple life. Buddha smiles on you.\n*   **Giant noise cancelling headphones resembling electric shock equipment:** You are Chuck Norris.\n\nAn assorted collection of desks and chairs adorns our office. People reflected on their lack of fitness and concluded that the blame lay squarely on their choice of furniture. So some people have standing desks — desks so high that you have to stand to use them (or as short folks like myself like to call them, any other desks).\n\nMarkets are chockablock with these desk+gym hybrids — standing desks, treadmill desks, cycling desks. This is why I feel bullish about my swimming desk idea — a big water tank with an infinity pool and a computer bolted on one side. Noise cancelling scuba masks, snorkels, and fins come as standard equipment.\n\nMy favourite mutant furniture, however, is the “balancing ball chair”. This chair has an exercise ball in place of a seat cushion. Let me repeat that: in place of a seat cushion, this chair has, a giant ball. It’s a great way to lose weight _(Pronounced: ˈdiɡnədē)_.\n\n| ![Balancing ball chair](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3jn30a31VkZY6qoz54eMYw.jpeg) |\n|:--:|\n| *Balancing ball chair* |\n\nOutside of Chobani, you’d be hard pressed to find a place that talks more about culture than Silicon Valley. We want to create an environment where employees are happy, motivated, healthy, and productive.\n\nSince people are happiest in the company of friends and family, we make sure you have work-life balance. This means you can work-from-home; on weekends. Notable exception is Yahoo. They let you home-from-work by allowing you to bring your infant to the office.\n\nOf course, we realize that not everyone has friends. So we let you bring your dog to work. Our office has a dog too. His name is Moses. He’s sensitive to sunlight.\n\n| ![Moses in a train](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*sE01zTx8QMZwcXw4QrnTgA.jpeg) |\n|:--:|\n| *Moses in a train* |\n\nUnlimited vacation policy is another perk at most good companies. Travelling, after all, is an important part of the human experience. All we ask is that you don’t leave at a time when your presence is sacrosanct for the company. It can be hard to judge that at times so here is a handy table to help you decide when you can go on a vacation:\n\n| ![Vacation guide for startup employees.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*fompXsY2010uPRkG1poa-g.png) |\n|:--:|\n| *Vacation guide for startup employees.* |\n\nMost startups provide lunch. Given the wide array of dietary preferences people have in SF, it’s a tricky proposition. It is fairly common to have someone who is a vegetarian, a vegan, on gluten-free, on paleo, and on juice detox in an office of 3 people. Allow me to explain these diets:\n\n*   **Vegetarians** don’t eat meat. I like vegetarians. I take comfort in the fact that if I am stranded with them in the Atlantic, ethically, I am one step closer to eating them than they are to eating me.\n*   **Vegans** don’t use anything that comes from animals — like milk, leather, meat, and Comcast.\n*   **Gluten-free** people don’t eat glue, which is a stupid diet to be on because no rational person eats glue. Based on that logic, I am on a painten-free diet because I don’t eat paint.\n*   People on **paleo** only eat foods available to paleolithic humans, like Mammoths and Megalodon sharks.\n*   **Juice detoxers** eat other people’s neurons because they don’t shut up about being on juice detox.\n\nOf course, we can’t talk about working in SF without actually talking about how we work.\n\nFirst rule of working in Silicon Valley — keep your emails short. If the recipient finds them rude, he/she needs a lesson in productivity _(and skin thickness augmentation)_. Here is a good email:\n\n| ![Supposedly short email](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Ft5aotP0cIUjyrZNgwu4-A.png) |\n|:--:|\n| *Supposedly short email* |\n\nIgnore the novella length signature; the brevity rule doesn’t apply to it. Put anything there — legalese, a call to save trees, a motivational quote. Not many people know that Twitter started out as an email service for Silicon Valley professionals but didn’t catch on because it allowed way too many characters.\n\nWe don’t have meetings; meetings are to startups what kryptonite is to Spiderman — out of place. So we have all-hands, one-on-ones, stand-ups, and huddles. Same goes for calls — we don’t make phone-calls. We sync-up, touch-base, or simply, connect. Make sure you set up the right one, or you may give people the impression that you are wasting their vocabulary.\n\nThe most sacred psalm of the startup-bible, though, is —\n\n> “Do things that don’t scale.”\n\nThis is why our first hire was a lousy mountain climber.\n\nOne last thing — the startup life does not stop at work; it affects your personal life too. E.g., if you work at a startup in San Francisco, you are like the guy selling plastic souvenirs at the Eiffel tower. Everyone at the Eiffel tower is selling plastic souvenirs. So you find yourself having the same conversations with similar people. Here is an example:\n\n**Alex**: I have a startup. We are Yelp for contractors.  \n**Ben**: I have a startup too. We are contractors for Yelp.  \n\\[Pause\\]  \n**Together**: Business model … yada yada yada [Paul Graham](http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/p/paul-graham) … [Series A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A) … lorem ipsum Google sucks.\n\nThis, in itself, is not a problem; I enjoy these conversations. The problem is that they often render you incapable of any other forms of communication. E.g.:\n\n**Girlfriend’s dad**: Great weather today.  \n**Ben**: Yeah. It’s beautiful.  \n\\[Pause\\]  \n\\[Longer pause\\]  \n**Ben**: So I see you use an iPhone. Android sucks, huh?\n\nFamous investor Marc Andreessen says:\n\n> Software is eating the world.\n\nThat explains why software is so shitty. Many things in the world — like Kanye, curling, and kale — are hard to digest.\n\nStill, technology is changing the way we live, the way we love, the way we work. And a lot of that technology is being built here in San Francisco.\n\nIf this sounds exciting, come on board; [Padlet is hiring](https://padlet.jobs), and so are a bazillion other startups. If you don’t live here and can’t relocate, don’t worry; many startups hire remotely. (Reddit isn’t anymore, FYI.)\n\nIf you are already a part of this world, why did you just waste 8 minutes? Why aren’t you working? Stop procrastinating and go ship stuff!""}"

You can scrap the display of a hierarchical navigation, because the user **_saw_** how they got there.\n\nOf course, the above ideas don’t work with every case — but this perspective can lead to much more elegant solutions to connect a flow.\n\n# An implemented example - Thinglist\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/528/0*IoFehxuS6xBU4HMz.gif)\n\n[Thinglist](http://appstore.com/thinglist), an [Elepath](http://elepath.com/) product I’m working on with Mister [Kyle Bragger](http://kylebragger.com/) has some pretty fun transitional interface work woven into it. The above example demonstrates how we reveal the new filtering feature.\n\n**Examples of Transitional interfaces you should check out:**\n\nYou know, I can’t really name many… On one end of the scale, there are a lot of beautiful, but dreadfully static interfaces. On the other end — ones that are over embellished with gimmicky animation.\n\nThree stand out to me right now.\n\n[Clear](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/): Very tight gesture driven animation.\n\n[Willcall](https://www.getwillcall.com/): Has a consistent, kinetic rhythm. There’s no hard pops between states. A lovely playfulness.\n\nFacebook.app: Not very consistent, but there’s some nice solutions to _drawing focus._ Specifically… drilling down into lightbox-like views for fullscreen photos, and popping comment inputs into list views.\n\nIt seems crazy to me that more people don’t think about interfaces with respect to the dimension of time. Motion can provide so much information! Maybe the tools to create prototypes are too complicated for most designers?\n\nI originally wrote this as an internal document for [Elepath](http://elepath.com/) employees, to begin to explain my obsession with motion. I am an [Animator](http://psql.carbonmade.com/) after all.\n\nWe figured it would be cool to share this for discussion. I’d love to hear thoughts from other people building interfaces, with a real consideration for how & why they move.\n\n_Do leave your comments here, or pipe up & chat to me on twitter:_ [_@pasql_](http://twitter.com/pasql)\n\n# If you’d like help with your next project, shoot me an email:\n\n_pasquale@thinko.com_\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*DyPeH4O7HGGDrNGkSLIw0Q.png)\n\nUpdate: [I expanded on this article as a 50 minute talk, which you can watch here ->](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMe0WnkF1Lc&feature=c4-overview&list=UURx1y52pfeMwbuer9Vh2u-A)\n\n\\*_I take no responsibility for you plunging down the rabbit hole and getting hooked on animation._""}"

It’s rare that you need to use your phone (or genitals for that matter) when in a social setting. There are obvious exceptions like your group needs directions or you want a reasonable amount of photos of a once-in-a-lifetime event (weddings, baby’s first steps). Brunches and sunsets happen every day. No need to miss the actual experience by snapping 5,000 pictures of it. Respecting these limits will enrich every interaction you have with every day objects, people, and life. If you feel the itch to pull out your phone in a break in the conversation…‘silence’ it. Undoubtedly your friends will whip theirs out, making the temptation almost unbearable. If you want to truly cleanse, this step is unbreakable. You can also influence your friends’ behaviors by playfully shaming them when they pull out their phones unnecessarily (‘Oh hey Hollywood!’). To get started with this one, I instructed my friends to punch my arm if I broke this rule in their presence. I adapted quickly. The _itch_ soon decreased. Slowly at first, but after a few days of withdrawal it was completely gone. I no longer relied on my phone to solve any anxiety or unnecessary emptiness. I was human again.\n2.  **Brain first, phone second.** Can’t think of the artist for a song you just heard? Siri can’t help you now. Exercise your brain, and try to figure it out for yourself. If you still can’t get it after a few minutes of focus, shift your attention to something else and it will come to you sooner than later. Be sure to carry a notepad (that’s right…actual pen and paper) to jot it down so worst case you can Google it later.\n3.  **Hide and delete.** This is the mobile cleanse mantra. Say it with me now… “Hummmmmmm…hide (inhale)…and delete (exhale)…and hide (inhale)…and delete (exhale).” You don’t need 200 apps. Uninstall the ones you no longer use and tuck the non-essentials into folders a few swipes from your main screen so it’s inconvenient to access them. You’ll soon realize how little you actually need them. My essentials include: phone, text, Spotify (music is my guilty pleasure. I’m not perfect), and Wunderlist (I’m a big fan of sole-focus task management…more on that in a second).\n4.  **Never push. Always pull.** Unless your wife is expecting a baby at any minute, there’s nothing more important than the people you are with in that moment. Turn **_ALL_** notifications & badges off. Set your phone to silent (not _VIBRATE_). Don’t even allow yourself the temptation to swipe and catch up on the latest insta-snap-vine-whatsapp-videos. Don’t take away from the beautiful, seemingly insignificant, uninstagrammable moment you are having with the people you love. These nasty notifications also distract you from work, hobbies, and passions. Keep your focus. Buzzfeed’s top 25 beach bodies can wait. When mobile browsing is acceptable, **_PULL_** the information you seek (manual refresh, etc). Don’t let it come to you. Cold turkey. No exceptions.\n5.  **Your delivery is free if it’s a mile or less.** Never Uber / Lyft / Sidecar if your destination is < 1mile. If weather and conditions permit, you can walk. Walk to the corner store for groceries. Get out of your house and and enjoy the fresh air (10 bonus points if you get to your destination without taking a picture. 20 points if you can walk without music. Another 50 points if you don’t need Google Maps to get there).\n6.  **Buy a watch.** I would often catch myself pulling out my phone to merely check the time (and then check the time again since I never actually remembered it the first time). This frequent ‘time check’ reenforced the habit of constantly pulling out my phone and undoubtedly led to unnecessary browsing if a waiting notification piqued my interest. Buy a watch. Wear it.\n7.  **No phones in the bedroom or bathroom.** Let’s focus on the bathroom first and [how much time you save](https://medium.com/) without your phone (see below for a non-scientific study of time spent on the toilet with and without a phone each day). Also the risk of accidentally dropping your iPhone in the toilet shoots dangerously close to zero if toilet tapping isn’t allowed. Now for the bedroom. It’s proven that [looking at bright screens](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/133/088/2320c993_92f3_b20b.jpg) just before bed increases the time it takes to fall asleep. Step 1 ABSOLUTELY applies in the bedroom. Imagine two star-crossed lovers staring deeply into eachothers’ phablets. Playfully destroying pigs or experiencing mind-numbing insta-gasms. Yeah you get the point. If there’s one experience I don’t want to miss for a new LinkedIn connection, it’s one where I can truly connect with the person I love.""},{""type"":""quote"",""text"":""> Time spent pooping""},{""type"":""image"",""text"":""| ![This is exaggerated.

To get started with this one, I instructed my friends to punch my arm if I broke this rule in their presence. I adapted quickly. The _itch_ soon decreased. Slowly at first, but after a few days of withdrawal it was completely gone. I no longer relied on my phone to solve any anxiety or unnecessary emptiness. I was human again.\n2.  **Brain first, phone second.** Can’t think of the artist for a song you just heard? Siri can’t help you now. Exercise your brain, and try to figure it out for yourself. If you still can’t get it after a few minutes of focus, shift your attention to something else and it will come to you sooner than later. Be sure to carry a notepad (that’s right…actual pen and paper) to jot it down so worst case you can Google it later.\n3.  **Hide and delete.** This is the mobile cleanse mantra. Say it with me now… “Hummmmmmm…hide (inhale)…and delete (exhale)…and hide (inhale)…and delete (exhale).” You don’t need 200 apps. Uninstall the ones you no longer use and tuck the non-essentials into folders a few swipes from your main screen so it’s inconvenient to access them. You’ll soon realize how little you actually need them. My essentials include: phone, text, Spotify (music is my guilty pleasure. I’m not perfect), and Wunderlist (I’m a big fan of sole-focus task management…more on that in a second).\n4.  **Never push. Always pull.** Unless your wife is expecting a baby at any minute, there’s nothing more important than the people you are with in that moment. Turn **_ALL_** notifications & badges off. Set your phone to silent (not _VIBRATE_). Don’t even allow yourself the temptation to swipe and catch up on the latest insta-snap-vine-whatsapp-videos. Don’t take away from the beautiful, seemingly insignificant, uninstagrammable moment you are having with the people you love. These nasty notifications also distract you from work, hobbies, and passions. Keep your focus. Buzzfeed’s top 25 beach bodies can wait. When mobile browsing is acceptable, **_PULL_** the information you seek (manual refresh, etc). Don’t let it come to you. Cold turkey. No exceptions.\n5.  **Your delivery is free if it’s a mile or less.** Never Uber / Lyft / Sidecar if your destination is < 1mile. If weather and conditions permit, you can walk. Walk to the corner store for groceries. Get out of your house and and enjoy the fresh air (10 bonus points if you get to your destination without taking a picture. 20 points if you can walk without music. Another 50 points if you don’t need Google Maps to get there).\n6.  **Buy a watch.** I would often catch myself pulling out my phone to merely check the time (and then check the time again since I never actually remembered it the first time). This frequent ‘time check’ reenforced the habit of constantly pulling out my phone and undoubtedly led to unnecessary browsing if a waiting notification piqued my interest. Buy a watch. Wear it.\n7.  **No phones in the bedroom or bathroom.** Let’s focus on the bathroom first and [how much time you save](https://medium.com/) without your phone (see below for a non-scientific study of time spent on the toilet with and without a phone each day). Also the risk of accidentally dropping your iPhone in the toilet shoots dangerously close to zero if toilet tapping isn’t allowed. Now for the bedroom. It’s proven that [looking at bright screens](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/133/088/2320c993_92f3_b20b.jpg) just before bed increases the time it takes to fall asleep. Step 1 ABSOLUTELY applies in the bedroom. Imagine two star-crossed lovers staring deeply into eachothers’ phablets. Playfully destroying pigs or experiencing mind-numbing insta-gasms. Yeah you get the point. If there’s one experience I don’t want to miss for a new LinkedIn connection, it’s one where I can truly connect with the person I love.\n\n> Time spent pooping\n\n| ![This is exaggerated. If you are actually pooping for 10 hours per day, please see a doctor.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*XsQuTmIByZlvpSsmDFLk5w.png) |\n|:--:|\n| *This is exaggerated. If you are actually pooping for 10 hours per day, please see a doctor.* |\n\n# With great power comes great responsibility\n\nI wish I could have made this lifestyle change a year ago. So many missed or wasted experiences. We have more computing power in our pocket than that necessary to put the first man on the moon. Yet we don’t know how to harness it because it’s advancing faster than our ability to absorb it into our lives in a healthy, constructive way. Remember kiddos…\n\n> An Apple a day keeps the doctor away. An Apple every 20 seconds…well…that’s too many fucking Apples.\n\nBest of luck with the cleanse. **_Please share / recommend_** this article to help friends become human again and tweet me directly (@jgvandehey) to let me know how it goes or if you need a sponsor, support, or tips. It is now safe to use your electronic device (in moderation).\n\n## TL;DR — We are on our phones too much. They were built to enhance our lives, not consume them. Be a human.""}"

It’s at least apples to oranges. Twitter is what we wanted it to be. It’s this realtime information network where everything in the world that happens on Twitter — important stuff breaks on Twitter and world leaders have conversations on Twitter. If that’s happening, I frankly don’t give a shit if Instagram has more people looking at pretty pictures.\n\nOf course, I am trivializing what Instagram is to many people. It’s a beautifully executed app that enables the creation and enjoyment of art, as well as human connection, which is often a good thing. But my rant had very little to do with it (or with Twitter). My rant was the result of increasing frustration with the one-dimensionality that those who report on, invest in, and build consumer Internet services talk about success.\n\n| ![Which rectangle is bigger?](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*OV1lSbV6qExNxms3jCSDwQ.jpeg) |\n|:--:|\n| *Which rectangle is bigger?* |\n\nAsk any junior high student which rectangle is bigger, one that is three inches wide or one that is two-and-a-half inches wide, and they’ll tell you it’s a nonsensical question unless they have more information — specifically, the height.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*sJXj1jTkcBi43ZiKgkbrjw.jpeg)\n\nAnd yet, we literally say one company or service is “bigger” based on a single number — specifically, number of people who have “used” it in the last 30 days. Even without getting into how “use” is defined, this is dumb.\n\nIn the recent Instagram/Twitter case, [Will Oremus’s piece in Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/12/10/instagram_hits_300_million_users_bigger_than_twitter_not_really.html) is the one I saw that didn’t just regurgitate the “bigger” headline. He does a great job of explaining why it’s not that simple. It’s worth a read, but the summary is this:\n\n> So is Instagram larger than Twitter? No — it’s different than Twitter. One is largely private, the other largely public. One focuses on photos, the other on ideas. They’re both very large, and they’re both growing.\n\n**Medium had its biggest week ever last week** — or so we might claim. By number of unique visitors to medium.com, we blew it out of the park. The main driver was a highly viral post that blew up (mostly on Facebook). However, the vast majority of those visitors stayed a fraction of what our average visitor stays, and they read hardly anything.\n\nThat’s why, internally, [our top-line metric is “TTR,”](https://medium.com/data-lab/mediums-metric-that-matters-total-time-reading-86c4970837d5) which stands for _total time reading._ It’s an imperfect measure of time people spend on story pages. We think this is a better estimate of whether people are actually getting value out of Medium. By TTR, last week was still big, but we had 50% more TTR during a week in early October when we had 60% as many unique visitors (i.e., there was way more actual reading per visit).\n\n[Mat Honan’s excellent _Wired_ article](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/new-media-2/) about the state of new media today accurately points out that everyone is in a “war for attention.” But it uses unique visitors as the way to compare how different outlets are doing in this war:\n\n| ![From Wired: [http://www.wired.com/2014/12/new-media-2/#slide-id-1674851:full](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/new-media-2/#slide-id-1674851:full)](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*JY_ATF3t4yl3GQ-Wooh2jw.jpeg) |\n|:--:|\n| *From Wired: [http://www.wired.com/2014/12/new-media-2/#slide-id-1674851:full](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/new-media-2/#slide-id-1674851:full)* |\n\nBy this metric (misleadingly labeled “readership”), Buzzfeed is “bigger” than _The New York Times._ But that’s the exact same metric that would tell us last week was bigger for Medium than that week in October. Even if _all_ we care about is attention — not any other value that may be important— this doesn’t tell us much. _Maybe_ BuzzFeed gets more attention, total, than _The Times_. But we should stop purporting that one-dimensional graphs like this tell us that.\n\n**More grains of salt:** The chart above — and a lot of the comparisons you read in the press about web site traffic — are based on Comscore’s numbers and only count U.S. users. Two big problems with this: 1) Most site operators will tell you their numbers vary greatly from Comscore’s. The smaller a site is, the more likely this is true (due to their sampling method). Although, Comscore will tell you that’s because they filter out duplicate users. 2) A small portion of total Internet users are in the U.S. Every site is global — but to very different degrees. So without a disclaimer that we’re only interested in the U.S., only showing U.S. numbers could be highly misleading.\n\nLastly, it’s not clear whether Comscore’s numbers include app traffic. I know they track app usage to some extent, but are they counting all of NYT’s apps in the above chart (or Buzzfeed’s)? (Leave a note here if you know.)\n\n**We pay more attention to time** spent reading than number of visitors at Medium because, in a world of infinite content — where there are a million shiny attention-grabbing objects a touch away and notifications coming in constantly — it’s meaningful when someone is actually _spending_ time. After all, for a currency to be valuable, it has to be scarce. And while the amount of attention people are willing to give to media and the Internet in general has skyrocketed — largely due to having a screen and connection with them everywhere — it eventually is finite.\n\nWe’re not alone in this view. Chartbeat’s Tony Haile has done a great job of [promoting the idea of an “Attention Web”](http://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/) (as opposed to the “Click Web”). He’s hopeful a shift to measuring attention will improve the web:\n\n> For quality publishers, valuing ads not simply on clicks but on the time and attention they accrue might just be the lifeline they’ve been looking for. Time is a rare scarce resource on the web and we spend more of our time with good content than with bad. Valuing advertising on time and attention means that publishers of great content can charge more for their ads than those who create link bait.\n\n[Upworthy is also beating the time-means-quality drum](http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/02/upworthy-has-a-new-way-of-measuring-engagement/):\n\n> We love thinking this way because it rewards us for sharing content that people really enjoy and find valuable — not just stuff they click on a lot. It may mean that we don’t do quite as well on uniques or pageviews, but that’s a tradeoff we’re happy to make because this is a metric focused on real user satisfaction.\n\nAnd in that Wired article, they mention why time is more valuable if you’re in the ad business:\n\n> Your clicks are valuable, and your eyeballs are valuable, but to advertisers your time is the most precious commodity of all — and publishers say they want to sell ads based on the time readers spend on their sites, not mere pageviews. So, the logic goes, the more time you spent with a story, the more expensive the accompanying ads would be.\n\n**The problem with time,** though, is it’s not actually measuring value. It’s measuring cost as a _proxy_ for value.\n\nAdvertisers don’t really want your time — they want to make an impression on your mind, consciously or subconsciously (and, ultimately, your money).\n\nAs the writer of this piece, I don’t really want your time — I want to make an impression on how you think. If my rhetorical skills let me do that in less time (for me and you), all the better.\n\nAt Medium, we don’t really want anyone’s time. We want to create a platform that enables people to make an impression on others. To make them think. To change their minds. To teach them something or connect emotionally. It’s hard to measure any of that.\n\nWhat if there was some new genre or form or author on Medium that was incredibly addictive and popular but, to our minds, didn’t seem of significant value or lasting import? The soap opera or Farmville of Medium posts, let’s say. Our TTR charts would probably go through the roof, and we’d have the illusion of success and be happy. But taking people’s time isn’t really the goal. And people wasting time is actually the opposite of the goal.\n\nThis is the problem with any one-dimensional metric. [As Jonah Peretti says](https://medium.com/matter/buzzfeeds-jonah-peretti-goes-long-e98cf13160e7), there’s no “God metric”:\n\n> I feel like what you see in the industry now is people jumping around and trying to find the God metric for content. It’s all about shares or it’s all about time spent or it’s all about pages or it’s all about uniques. The problem is you can only optimize one thing and you have to pick, otherwise all you’re doing is making a bunch of compromises if you try to optimize for multiple things.\n\n**In the early days at Google,** I remember [the (crayon) chart on the wall](http://www.fastcompany.com/46507/between-lines) was number of queries.

That means we have something people want.\n\nHowever, almost all of them have no idea that they want Slack. How could they? They’ve never heard of it. And only a vanishingly small number will have imagined it on their own. They think they want something different (if they think they want anything at all). They definitely are not looking for Slack. (But then no-one was looking for Post-it notes or GUIs either.)\n\nJust as much as our job is to build something genuinely useful, something which really does make people’s working lives simpler, more pleasant and more productive, our job is also to understand what people think they want and then translate the value of Slack into their terms.\n\nA good part of that is “just marketing,” but even the best slogans, ads, landing pages, PR campaigns, etc., will fall down if they are not supported by the experience people have when they hit our site, when they sign up for an account, when they first begin using the product and when they start using it day in, day out.\n\nTherefore, “understanding what people think they want and then translating the value of Slack into their terms” _is something we all work on._ It is the sum of the exercise of all our crafts. We do it with copy accompanying signup forms, with fast-loading pages, with good welcome emails, with comprehensive and accurate search, with purposeful loading screens, and with thoughtfully implemented and well-functioning features of all kinds.\n\n# “Marketing from Both Ends”\n\nMuch has been written about “product-market fit” in the last few years, probably as a result of the popularity of the lean startup movement (though the idea has been around much longer). The term refers to the degree to which a product _could_ be successful, given sufficient promotion, appropriate pricing, adequate customer support and so on (before you find that fit, all the pushing in the world won’t get you up the hill).\n\nIn this [classic post](http://blog.jedchristiansen.com/pmarcaarchive/the-pmarca-guide-to-startups-part-4-the-only/) on Marc Andreessen’s old blog, he calls getting to product-market fit the “only thing that matters” for startups and offers a way of thinking about the life of the startup that divides it into two distinct phases: before product-market fit and after. Once the product fits the market, a company is able to step on the gas, spending to promote a product that will actually sell. The things you need to do before are very different from the things you need to do after (generally test & iterate vs scale & optimize).\n\nWe are right in the middle of that first phase. It seems we are doing well and there are many encouraging signs, but we’re definitely still in the first phase and it is very, very hard to tell how far we have to go to cross over into the promised land (the last 10% is 90% of the work, etc.) So, we should be working carefully from _both_ the product end and the market end:\n\n*   Doing a better and better job of providing what people want (whether they know it or not)\n*   Communicating the above more and more effectively (so that they know they want it)\n\nIn the best case, there is a dialectic at play here: the product itself and the way people use it should suggest new ways of articulating the value — and refinements to how we communicate the value should lead to principles which clarify decision-making around product features and design.\n\nOur position is different than the one many new companies find themselves in: we are not battling it out in a large, well-defined market with clear incumbents (which is why we can’t get away with “[Other group chat products are poisonous. Slack is toasted](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1059578/quotes?item=qt0472849).”). Despite the fact that there are a handful of direct competitors and a muddled history of superficially similar tools, we are setting out to define a new market. And that means we can’t limit ourselves to tweaking the product; we need to tweak the market too.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*oO7uwYs0NMWV7B4mUCuoIw.png)\n\n# Sell the innovation, not the product\n\nThe best — maybe the only? — real, direct measure of “innovation” is change in human behaviour. In fact, it is useful to take this way of thinking as definitional: innovation _is_ the sum of change across the whole system, not a thing which _causes_ a change in how people behave. No small innovation ever caused a large shift in how people spend their time and no large one has ever failed to do so.\n\nBy that measure, Slack is a real and large innovation. It is not as eye-catching as self-driving cars or implantable chips — it is not basic research-y kind of stuff. But, for organizations that adopt it, there will be a dramatic shift in how time is spent, how communication happens, and how the team’s archives are utilized. There will be changes in how team members relate to one another and, hopefully, significant changes in productivity.\n\nWe are unlikely to be able to sell “a group chat system” very well: there are just not enough people shopping for group chat system (and, as pointed out elsewhere, our current fax machine works fine).\n\n> That’s why what we’re selling is organizational transformation.\n\nWhat we are selling is _not_ the software product — the set of all the features, in their specific implementation — because there are just not many buyers for this software product. (People buy “software” to address a need they already know they have or perform some specific task they need to perform, whether that is tracking sales contacts or editing video.)\n\nHowever, if we are selling “a reduction in the cost of communication” or “zero effort knowledge management” or “making better decisions, faster” or “all your team communication, instantly searchable, available wherever you go” or “75% less email” or some other valuable _result_ of adopting Slack, we will find many more buyers.\n\nThat’s why what we’re selling is organizational transformation. The software just happens to be the part we’re able to build & ship (and the means for us to get our cut).\n\nWe’re selling a reduction in information overload, relief from stress, and a new ability to extract the enormous value of hitherto useless corporate archives. We’re selling better organizations, better teams. That’s a good thing for people to buy and it is a much better thing for us to sell in the long run. We will be successful to the extent that we create better teams.\n\nTo see why, consider the hypothetical Acme Saddle Company. They could just sell saddles, and if so, they’d probably be selling on the basis of things like the quality of the leather they use or the fancy adornments their saddles include; they could be selling on the range of styles and sizes available, or on durability, or on price.\n\nOr, they could sell _horseback riding_. Being successful at selling horseback riding means they grow the market for their product while giving the perfect context for talking about their saddles.

If you don’t believe me, there are a bunch of talks on YouTube, where you can watch people brag about how awesome they are because they can code to an audience that actually is listening and impressed.\n\nWhile the image of developers has changed from some members of the general public — and I don’t have to feel embarrassed telling people I program computers for a living anymore— beginners that are looking to become software developers face a whole slew of problems that I never had to face.\n\n# Problem #1: You NEED to Learn HTML9 Responsive BoilerStrap JS (or whatever JS Framework is trending today on HackerNews)\n\nThere’s a lot of hype out there about the next latest and greatest programming fad.\n\nA lot of progress is being made in the programming world, but in general there’s not a silver-bullet single technology someone can learn that will immediately cure all their problems.\n\nBeginners are often encouraged to start digging into solutions for problems they don’t understand yet.\n\nThe hype can cause someone to try to learn about things like the **_Virtual DOM_**, or **_Shadow DOM_**, before they even understand what the **_regular DOM_** is. When beginners are starting out there isn’t a lot of talk about “learning to crawl before you learn to walk”, instead there is a lot more about the latest and greatest fad.\n\nAs a seasoned web developer, I love playing with these new technologies as they come out, but I know that it’s important to use the right tool for the job. Beginners often feel like learning how to fit a square-peg through a round-hole is the fastest way to level up their coding skills.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things learning the latest trend isn’t important. Nobody is really saying this explicitly to the community.\n\n# Problem #2: Fundamentals Aren’t Sexy\n\nHere’s a list of things that you probably will never see trend on HackerNews and seldom put in most job postings:\n\n_Data Structures, Linked Lists, Trees, Depth First Search, Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm._\n\nHowever it’s also a list of some stuff that comes up incredibly frequently on technical interviews.\n\n**The disconnect between “UnderbackJS” or whatever is listed on job postings today leave beginners thinking they need to chase and catch up with the latest trend to get the job, not get a solid foundation in what really matters.**\n\nThe “Learn to Code Community” is very much an echo-chamber, that can confuse beginners. Unfortunately people with years of experience communicating with other seasoned developers don’t realize what they say will likely be taken out of context by beginners.\n\nAs experienced developers, most of the time we care more about a solid foundation and analytical skills rather than experience with the specific tools of the trade. Having hired many solid engineers who learned the specific technologies on the job, knowing specific stuff is generally overrated.\n\n# Problem #3: People (kind of) Know What They Are Doing Now\n\n**_I wrote some seriously bad code on my first jobs as a web developer_**. Frameworks were just coming out and everyone had been developing in either PHP or CGI. This whole framework thing was relatively new, so I started on relatively equal footing as everyone else.\n\nI made every mistake in the book and my second job in web development had me asking questions like “_what the heck is a unit test?_”. Live and learn. The developer in me is a little bit afraid to know that a lot of the code I wrote long ago, when I was starting out, is still alive in the wild.\n\nBut now, people have been writing web applications for many years, and have developed a lot of best practices. On the one hand this means that with code reviews and communicating about code people can get up to speed. It’s possible for people to learn what we as a community took a decade to figure-out in a short period of time in comparison.\n\nOn the flip side it’s a bit overwhelming to try to fully grok some of the nuances that the community currently talks about. Things like:\n\n*   **Monoliths are great!**\n*   **Microservices are where it’s at my friend!**\n*   **Microservices are overrated. Monoliths are back in vogue!**\n*   **Turbolinks?**\n\nAs a community we have 10+ years of baggage we’re lugging around. It makes it easy for us to have context about how the world has been in the past. But hopefully the beginners of today will never have to muck-through a big shitty monolith similar to what I was building in 2008.\n\n# Problem #4: People Still Have No Idea What They’re Doing (and that’s ok)\n\nWhen starting out, it’s normal to compare yourself to other people, but in general doing so is a bad idea.\n\nIt’s hard to compare yourself with someone who has much more experience than you. This causes beginners often think to themselves:\n\n> When am I going to learn everything I need to know? I still feel like there’s a lot out there that I need to learn.\n\nThe answer of course is a hard one for them to fully appreciate. It’s nobody ever learns everything that they ever need to, and if that ever happens that you’re not learning something new every day, it’s time to look for a new and more challenging set of problems to tackle.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1300/1*4hfUKetUa3Q-2lqc568_ag.jpeg)\n\nWatching talks by Aaron Patterson where he dives into Ruby’s C source code, or using _RubyVM::InstructionSequence_ to figure out what happens under the hood, or how journey implements routing in rails with finite automata instead of regexes still melts my face. Watching those talks is a good reminder of how clueless I am about the inner workings of a lot of things…\n\n# Problem #5: Some of the most important lessons about programming you need to learn by messing things up big time.\n\n![Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*PNaL3O-7cvB8Y_oejEYhgQ.jpeg)\n\nIf you’ve never made a mistake that brought some mission-critical software component screech to a halt, you’ve never really been under the gun to fix things. If that’s the case there are still lessons to learn.\n\nNon-technical people walking to your desk to tell you about some problem you already know about, teaches you a lot. Especially if you are busy desperately trying it. Books can’t teach these kinds of lessons.\n\n# Problem #6: Systems Have Gotten Complex\n\nHere’s an example of how things have gotten more complex with Ruby on Rails:\n\n> In 2008: In order to have your site live on the Internet you needed to spin up a server yourself and configure all the components: apache & mongrel.\n\nBut today:\n\n> Today: git push heroku master.

Our mobile app buzzed in your pocket when friends were near and ushered in a new wave of “[Ambient Social Networking](http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/06/all-the-location-apps-you-have-to-use-at-the-sxsw-royal-rumble/)” companies. Downloaded by millions of people all over the world, Sonar was promoted by Apple and Google in 100+ countries, won numerous awards such as runner-up at TechCrunch Disrupt and Ad:Tech Best Mobile Startup, raised nearly $2,000,000 from prominent angels and VCs, and was featured on more than 300 publications including the New York Times, CNN, CNBC, TechCrunch, and TIME.\n\nAnd yet, we failed.\n\nWe did lots of things right and lots of things wrong at Sonar. Below I do my best to share a few of our lessons learned.\n\n# The Search For Product/Market Fit\n\n> “Make something people want.” —Paul Graham\n\n## Listening to your users: False positives\n\nWe launched Sonar with Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare support. Shortly thereafter, users buffeted us with requests for Linkedin integration. Ostensibly, they wanted to use the app to meet fellow professionals.\n\nEager to please, we rushed to add Linkedin. The net effect? Nada. My guess is that the people asking were not actual users, but rather people that “wanted to be” users. We had mistaken noise for signal.\n\n**_Lesson learned:_**\n\n“I would use your product if only you had X feature” is a dangerous signal to follow. Users do their best to anticipate what they want before they’ve seen it but, like entrepreneurs, they are often wrong.\n\nEnterprise companies should validate demand by asking customers to put their money where their mouths are. Media and social networking companies should double down on analytics to find, observe, and build for actual user behavior.\n\n## Listening to your users: False negatives\n\nOne of the most requested features was a “map like foursquare” for our check-ins. Instead, we appended a simple “@Sonar” to content that users shared from our app. Although we had designs for a map, we never got around to building one. We were too busy building the future of ambient social networking!\n\nMistake. People [didn’t like](http://www.quora.com/How-can-I-remove-the-sonarme-from-tweets-when-using-the-Sonar-app-on-my-iPhone) the bland “@Sonar” text string so they stopped sharing updates from Sonar. Their friends never engaged with our updates in the first place. Facebook noticed this and started hiding our posts. Instead of optimizing for actual user behavior, we spent countless whiteboarding sessions trying in vain to design an alternative.\n\n**_Lesson learned:_**\n\nYou are probably not the Steve Jobs of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\nRemoving friction from existing user behaviors (e.g. checkins) almost always has a higher ROI than building castles in the sky (e.g. hypothesizing about your API). Find all the [dead ends/local maxima](http://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/56882927895/iterative-testing-vs-big-swings-in-product-design) in your current products before building new ones!\n\n## Growth vs. Engagement\n\nWe received conflicting advice from lots of smart people about which is more important. We focused on engagement, which we improved by orders of magnitude. No one cared.\n\n**_Lesson learned:_**\n\nGrowth is the only thing that matters if you are building a social network. Period. Engagement is great but you aren’t even going to get the meeting unless your top-line numbers reach a certain threshold (which is different for seed vs. series A vs. selling advertising).\n\n# Things I Wish I Spent Less Time On\n\n> “Focus is saying no to 1,000 good ideas.” — Steve Jobs\n\n## Events\n\nI realized the error of my customer acquisition strategy as I awkwardly made my way through a small Meetup I had just pitched. It was 11pm on a Tuesday, I was exhausted and still had real work to do once I got home. Yet there I was, in a shitty bar trying not to skewer anyone with my Sonar sign as I dodged person after person asking me to install THEIR app.\n\n**_Lesson Learned:_**\n\nEvents are for research, business development, and hiring; NOT for getting to 10,000,000 downloads.\n\n## Brands & Agencies\n\nWhen MTV, Kraft, Digitas, and the like reached out to us we weren’t sure what they wanted. It took us at least 10 meetings to realize that, rather than delivering us millions of their customers on a silver platter, they were keeping tabs on us so that they could get access to OUR audience if we ever took off!\n\n**_Lesson Learned:_**\n\nBe polite, but postpone brand and agency “intros” until you’ve built your own audience. If you build it, they will come (and pay).\n\nCorollary: Investors know this. You sound stupid when you talk about your impending “big deal” with “XYZ brand” that’s going to drive massive customer acquisition and revenue.\n\n## Side projects\n\nIn the winter of 2011, we signed a partnership w/ Wired magazine to demonstrate our technology by providing visitors of their Times Square popup store with personalized in-store product recommendations.\n\nThat “small side project” cost us 6 weeks of development and delivered no appreciable benefit other than getting to hang out with the cool people at Wired.\n\n**_Lesson Learned:_**\n\nYou do not have 20% time. Identify your top three priorities. Throw away numbers two and three.\n\n## Competition\n\nIn the run up to SXSW 2012 when the insider media had fabricated Highlight as heir to the throne and some of our more fair weather investors had written us off, my confidence was against the ropes. We reordered our roadmap to rush out comparable features but were now BEHIND. I put on my best brave face but inside my gut was rotting away. I still remember thinking on the flight to Austin “fck, we had it, and now we are going to lose it.”\n\nOops! Highlight never went anywhere but we definitely wasted a ton of energy and sleep “responding to the threat” when we should have been figuring out how to make our own business work.\n\n**_Lesson Learned:_**\n\nBe steady at the wheel. The only way one startup can kill another startup is by getting into the other’s head and leading them off a cliff.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, try this proof. Are your competitors releasing a bunch of the same features that you have on your roadmap? Yes? Do you know what consumers want\\*? No? Great, then neither do your competitors. Get back to figuring out what users want!\n\n\\*Hint: If you did, you would already have traction.\n\n## Selling the company\n\nWhen the ambient social networking space iced over in the spring of 2012, Sonar’s controlling investors decided it was time to “flip the asset.” They connected us with a daily deals company looking for “Big Data” solutions. We stopped working on the app and devoted all of our resources to repacking our backend technology to solve BigCo’s problems. Instead of paring down expenses to extend our dwindling runway, we piled on hires and ramped up our infrastructure.\n\nThe daily deals space imploded but we spent nearly nine months, dozens of meetings, and several hundred thousand dollars “selling” Sonar into a company that nearly went bankrupt.\n\n**_Lesson Learned:_**\n\nCompanies don’t get sold, they get bought. The best way to get bought is to build something of value. That’s hard to do when you are trying to sell.\n\n## Misalignment\n\nWe built Sonar out of an incubator that I helped launch in 2010. To be absolutely clear, the incubator was instrumental to getting Sonar off the ground and helped us considerably along the way. Unfortunately, there are a number of structural issues facing incubators and the operators they employ. I address some of these below.\n\nThe decoupling of responsibility from control created ambiguity and confusion, tension and frustration for all parties. From day to day decisions such as negotiating an employment contract to company defining ones such as when to sell the firm, alignment was a constant challenge. Occasionally, we were simply at odds.\n\nPerhaps the most detrimental aspect of the incubator model was not its potential for hinderance but its facility as a crutch. As someone responsible for building and running a company that I ultimately didn’t control, it was far too easy to point a finger.\n\nIn my opinion, the most tragic example came when our incubator sat on a financing that would have rebooted the company. After nearly a month at loggerheads, our would-be investors gave us 48 hours to “take it or leave it.” In hopes of saving the company, I made an ultimatum: we move forward together or I would have to walk away. No one budged, time elapsed, and our term sheet evaporated. I resigned as promised, blaming them for killing my baby.\n\n**_Lesson Learned:_**\n\nAs John Burroughs said, “A man can fail many times, but he isn’t a failure until he begins to blame somebody else.” Avoid bad relationships like the plague but when you inevitably find yourself in a difficult partnership, don’t waste precious energy wailing against it. Make it work or move on quickly.\n\n# It’s All About People\n\n> “The essence of competitiveness is liberated when we make people believe that what they think and do is important – and then get out of their way while they do it.” — Jack Welch\n\n## Be practical about team building\n\nWe lost our first would-be hire, a fantastic Google engineer. While we were debating his contract, he was taking a job elsewhere. Conversely, we hired another, much less proven, engineer on the spot. While he ultimately wasn’t a great cultural fit and we definitely waited too long to part ways, he was instrumental in getting V1 out the door.\n\n**_Lesson Learned:_**\n\nIf you are an experienced entrepreneur with lots of options, by all means, hold out. For most first time entrepreneurs, holding out risks never getting off the ground.\n\nIn the beginning, established people probably won’t work with you. Prove yourself by finding diamonds in the rough, like yourself. With their help, you can level up your organization and convince the big fish to join.\n\n## Culture is your cofounder\n\nWe built an amazing team at Sonar. Everyone was extremely smart, passionate, dedicated, and hardworking. We celebrated milestones with tequila. We hung at the beach. Even when times were tough, everyone pushed as far as they possibly could, and then some. I have big love for all of my former colleagues and am confident they feel similarly.\n\nThat said, our culture was more of an emergent property than a deliberate choice. Sure, we had brainstorming sessions and posted goals prominently but most of our culture we absorbed from the people with whom we surrounded ourselves.\n\n**_Lesson Learned:_**\n\nThink of culture as a cofounder that is present when you are not. You are decisive, communicative, and respectful but it’s your culture that helps everyone know how to act when you are out of the room. Give that voice clarity and authority.\n\nThe trick is to avoid hollow words. Since a startup’s culture ultimately mirrors that of its founder, maybe the best thing that you can do is work hard to get clear on who you are. Write that down and share it with your team. If you’ve been honest, every action you take will reinforce your values.\n\n# Onward\n\n“What we fight with is so small, and when we win, it makes us small.
