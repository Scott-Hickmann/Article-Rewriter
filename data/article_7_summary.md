On February 23, 2022, the Telegram channel [Wakes grew to over 625,000 subscribers and is now one of the top Telegram channels in Russia, with a reach of more than 30 million daily views.](https://t.me/warfakes)

The War on Fakes’ operators [describe themselves on its English-language website as “the owners and administrators of several non-political telegram channels. They continue, "We consider it important to provide objective information about what is happening in Ukraine and the territories of Donbass.](https://waronfakes.com/)

Microsoft Edge and Firefox malware detectors warn that the site is malicious.

A scan of the channel's posts makes it clear that War on Fakes is not objective, instead pushing content to support narratives echoed by Russian state media and the Kremlin.

The channel has started to receive some attention from mainstream Russian propaganda outlets, such as *RIA Novosti. The channel has claimed a heavily circulated photo of a Russian airstrike in Chuhuiv was likely faked.*

The claim that the photo is staged has been been [debunked](https://www.logically.ai/factchecks/library/ca6d93d1), as metadata showed that the Chuhuiv airstrike; the photographer is a well-respected photojournalist; and the woman herself, Olena Kurilo, [spoke out after the event, showing the same injuries as those in the original photo.](https://twitter.com/euronews/status/1496857321909239818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1496857321909239818%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marca.com%2Fen%2Flifestyle%2Fworld-news%2F2022%2F02%2F24%2F6216fca2ca4741a0458b4599.html)

The DFRLab subsequently ran the image provided by War on Fakes through Microsoft's Face Verification tool, which uses facial recognition algorithms to determine the likelihood that two faces are the same person. This is a considerably low score, even taking into account that one of the images includes facial injuries.

The video makes hundreds of other highly controversial claims, including that the corpses seen in photos of an attack on a Kyiv TV tower may have been brought in from a nearby morgue.

RIA Novosti editor-in-Chief, and propagandist [Vladimir Soloviev, have gained significant traction domestically in Russia, and continues to be amplified by prominent Russian outlets.](https://t.me/rian_ru/148741)

The flagship War on Fakes is now attempting to expand through multiple region-specific channels and translations of its website into French, Spanish and Chinese.

Use of conventional Russian influence tactics, and clear goal of maintaining popular support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine all hint that its operators may be either affiliated with the Kremlin, or have the resources and incentive to carry out an influence operation in support of it.
