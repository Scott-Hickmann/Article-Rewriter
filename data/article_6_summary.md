My friend in Kyiv wrote on Twitter,



My grandfather liberated Belsen concentration camp, and never really recovered from what he saw.

Putin didn't realise Ukraine has been open to the world ever since it kicked out his last puppet dictator. Ukraine is not a far-away place with which we have no emotional ties.

The Russian economy is now toxic. Everything is being withdrawn from Russia. Putin's Russia is becoming North Korea, not the great Imperial Russia of its past.

Putin too will be apologising for for the next 50-80 years.

We would now consider racist jokes about Germans were completely acceptable. This was because the people I grew up around had been bombed by Germans, fought against Germans, known people who were killed by the Germans.

My grandparentsâ€™ generation had mostly died. Whilst they were alive, and I would have received harsh comments and surprised looks if I had gone to Germany or had German friends, let alone bought a German car.

Germany is a new country, with new generations of people, and both have set an impressive example when it comes to owning and building positively on their history.

I was out one night in Berlin. We saw a teenage boy sitting in a doorway weeping. With tears in his eyes he told us he had just been studying what his country had done in the war.

We were, a British Jew and a young German in a wonderfully diverse and open city, talking freely, embracing. It was OK now. But I knew he would spend the coming years working out how to disentangle himself from his country's history.

If Germany makes Germany's great nation now, and a beacon for peace and freedom.

A Russian couple were sitting opposite me looking up at them, I noticed other people looking at them. I realised that things have just shifted for all Russians, without many of them yet realising it. It may not be fair or justified.

If the Russian army kills my friends, I will never forget that or forgive it. It will shape my whole relationship with Russia for the rest of my life.

Our children will grow up with stories of this war, with the raw grief and anger we are feeling. It is unfair on all those thousands thousands of Russians who have been arrested for protesting against this war.

Putin wanted to shape Russian history and secure his place in that history; he has succeeded. He will now be remembered for bombing civilians, destroying beautiful cities, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.

If Putin sent a huge army into a peaceful country and killed women, children, and fellow Slavs for no reason beyond hubris and ego. Like Hitler and Stalin, he will be hated forever.

Putin will have to disentangle themselves from these crimes just as young Germans have had to do. The damage Putin has done to Russia over the last week is greater than all the harm he has done over theLast few decades.

Russia will spend a generation or more rebuilding its image. A visceral, almost genetic anger will now flow down through the generations.

Putin set out to build a greater Germany, and ended up destroying everywhere else including Germany. Putin is destroying Russia, and he is also destroying Russia.
