"This morning I woke up to the hopeful news that some Russian forces are [pulling back from the border](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60392259) with Ukraine. Unfortunately, this isn’t quite the positive sign it might appear.

Anyone who understands Russian military history and doctrine knows that Moscow relies on what is often called _maskirovka_.

Russiaphobic bigots [like Anne Applebaum](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/lavrov-russia-diplomacy-ukraine/622075/) pretend this means Russians are always lying, but this isn’t at all the case. Maskirovka is about keeping an opponent guessing about your true intentions, and nothing more — everything else is just fluff designed to muddy waters.

Putin, an old KGB hand, knows this game and plays it well. Everything Russia has done for the past year makes perfect sense if you accept that what Putin is after is in fact very simple.","This morning I woke up to the hopeful news that some Russian forces are pulling back from the border with Ukraine.

In exchange European leaders get a ready-made excuse to let America do their dirty work while acting in public like they’re restraining America’s worst impulses.","He wants Ukraine to become a Russian client state like it used to be, as Belarus is today.

"Putin stays in power by promising enough of the right people he’ll make sure this is always the case. So he has an incentive to look into the future and estimate where Russia _could_ be in a decade.

From Putin’s perspective Ukraine must be neutralized, and the fact the Zelensky government refuses to shelve NATO membership amplifies his concerns. Putin is clearly determined to end the unstable situation along the Russia-Ukraine border one way or another and while he is probably bluffing about surrounding Kyiv, the threat of it happening can’t be ignored.","Putin stays in power by promising enough of the right people he’ll make sure this is always the case.

"The irony is that _so far_ all Putin has done is load his weapon and do some target practice around Ukraine.

"What’s darkly hilarious about watching the Biden Administration pretend it can deter Russian actions by pointing out everything they are talking about doing is that it gives Russia a direct means of faking America out. Knowing that Biden is going to publicly warn about every crazy plot someone discusses in Moscow, Putin has been able to trap him in a dynamic where America looks like its crying chicken little every five minutes.

A beneficial side effect, from Putin’s perspective, is that Biden, with every warning not backed by threat of meaningful action, weakens America’s position. If any diplomatic deal prevents the outbreak of war it will stem from German efforts underway this week.

Putin pulling back some troops from the border ahead of the new German chancellor Scholz is a classic technique.

"The real deterrent to a major invasion is the fact that, contrary to his own insistence that Russians and Ukrainians will always be the same people, a big war will permanently sever whatever bonds remain. Even if an insurgency doesn’t kill hundreds of Russian soldiers, eventually Ukraine will be free again.

Because this truth runs up against objective 5, all-out conquest is the least likely outcome. Putin is more cautious than people give him credit for and Russia’s newly-professional military is as casualty averse and reliant on firepower as America’s — moving in after a collapse of the Kyiv government is a distinct possibility, but it is doubtful an invasion will be the tool to bring this about except in the last resort.

A substantial military defeat in Ukraine’s east, however, would prove both NATO’s unwillingness to assist and Zelensky’s inability to protect his people. A limited operation opens the door to further conquest through non-military means.","The real deterrent to a major invasion is the fact that, contrary to his own insistence that Russians and Ukrainians will always be the same people, a big war will permanently sever whatever bonds remain.

"Troop deployments aside, Putin does not want to conquer Ukraine by force. Having to do this would represent a partial failure of his own strategy and probably lead to a united European Union response which will be worse for Russia than a united NATO.

Everything he has done to get NATO and America in a tizzy has been designed to prove one thing to Ukraine: you are alone.","Troop deployments aside, Putin does not want to conquer Ukraine by force. Having to do this would represent a partial failure of his own strategy and probably lead to a united European Union response which will be worse for Russia than a united NATO. The Transatlantic Alliance will always be hindered by America’s ongoing collapse, a process Russia can now actively intensify if it chooses — and might, as part of Putin’s ultimate revenge for the fall of the Soviet Union.

"And Ukraine is. America is running away just like it did in Afghanistan, Biden entirely concerned about his domestic audience and pitiful chances at re-election in 2024. A classic politician who cares only for his own interests, Biden cannot be trusted and is as much an accelerator of America’s demise at this point as Trump.

Putin’s maskirovka is designed to obscure his core aims. Objective 5 is on his horizon, but Putin is savvy enough to realize he doesn’t get it if there’s an all-out war.

Instead, after a sufficient provocation now or this summer, Russia can simply sit back and bombard Ukraine for days or weeks with weapons Ukraine can’t stop. A direct invasion of Ukraine at any point will follow an initial campaign intended to paralyze and crush Ukraine’s armed forces in the east because in all warfare the core requirement is to defeat you enemy’s military, not capture their cities.

So the likely course of events if war breaks out soon goes like this:","And Ukraine is.

"*   Russia makes several moves that keep a door open to negotiations and imply a willingness to back down
*   An accident or intentional attack kills Russian soldiers or Russian-speakers in Ukraine
*   Putin gives Zelensky an ultimatum, threatening a total invasion if he doesn’t accede to Russian demands
*   If Zelensky resists, separatists in Donbas begin making advances backed by Russian artillery and air strikes.
*   Putin denies an invasion is underway even as Ukraine’s forces are smashed from the air. If sanctions drop, he escalates by striking more of Ukraine’s military infrastructures. If Ukraine negotiates, the attacks stop.

At this point it’s on America to go ahead with its sanctions threat while Russia insists it’s not invading anyone, just supporting people under attack. The major attack I fear could involve chemical weapons in order to directly call into question American assertions of Russian responsibility and remind the world of the lies that got America into Iraq.","Russia makes several moves that keep a door open to negotiations and imply a willingness to back down * An accident or intentional attack kills Russian soldiers or Russian-speakers in Ukraine * Putin gives Zelensky an ultimatum, threatening a total invasion if he doesn’t accede to Russian demands * If Zelensky resists, separatists in Donbas begin making advances backed by Russian artillery and air strikes. * Putin denies an invasion is underway even as Ukraine’s forces are smashed from the air.

"If major fighting begins, it continues until Zelensky agrees to terms or falls to a coup after Ukraine’s military is decimated. Russia’s forces surrounding Ukraine give Putin options he can elect to deploy one at a time or all at once.

Maskirovka, like all Russian military doctrine, is based on the Soviet experiences in the Second World War. Russia doesn’t see war like the definition-obsessed Americans do — it isn’t something declared, waged, then ended.

War is politics, and politics is war — Russia has learned Clausewitz’ lesson better than anyone. All conflict takes place on a continuum and each move made is part of a deeper, multi-layered game. Violence is merely a tool, deployed as needed to prove a point.

I hope, hope, hope a conflict can still be averted.

"The world has ended before.

Just look up the word _Holodomor_, an engineered famine that killed anywhere from 4 to 10 million people in Ukraine during a single winter. The word means mass murder by starvation. Ukraine officially considers it genocide, as do a handful of other countries. Here’s what happened: Under Stalin, The Soviet Union forced the country to over-harvest in order to meet staggering grain quotas, which led to famine. In other words, they stole another country’s crops. Then they stormed into homes and confiscated food. Left with nothing, people turned to cannibalism.

"Here’s an interesting detail about The _Holodomor:_ Ukrainian farmers tried to warn Stalin’s bureaucrats about over-farming.

They didn’t **_listen_**.

They engaged in exactly the kind of wishful thinking and false hope that we see so much of now. They dismissed warnings about a harsh winter as “doomsaying.” Soviet idiots forced their version of “normal,” along with their grain quotas and productivity expectations, down Ukraine’s throat, then sat back and judged them for the fallout.

History explains why all these wishful thinkers and positivity nuts piss us off so much when they pop up to accuse us of pessimism and negative thinking.

"500,000 followers to the average person might seem like a phenomenal feat. To every TikToker I talked to, it wasn’t enough. Surprisingly, nearly all of them were still unsatisfied, wary, and unconfident in how robust their followings were. If they stopped posting tomorrow, would their followers forget about them?

TikTok doesn’t prioritize loyalty. As a creator, you have no clue how many real fans you have. It’s so easy for someone to hit the like and follow button and never engage with your account again. The reality is 50,000 on YouTube or 5,000 followers on Twitter is still more valuable than half a million on TikTok.

To every TikToker I talked to, it wasn’t enough. Surprisingly, nearly all of them were still unsatisfied, wary, and unconfident in how robust their followings were. If they stopped posting tomorrow, would their followers forget about them? TikTok doesn’t prioritize loyalty. As a creator, you have no clue how many real fans you have. It’s so easy for someone to hit the like and follow button and never engage with your account again. The reality is 50,000 on YouTube or 5,000 followers on Twitter is still more valuable than half a million on TikTok.

"If you’re trying to grow a following, TikTok has hands down the best algorithm for reach. Nowhere else are you guaranteed to have a video go viral as easily, or have the chance to reach such wildly diverse audiences.

"The tensions in Ukraine have become a challenge to sovereignty and self-determination. After the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declared its independence in 1991. Since then, Russia has had difficulty recognizing it as a country at all.

To say it’s simply because President Putin is an egomaniac is to not understand the situation. He is an egomaniac, but no more so than any other person who rises to the same height of leadership. Russia has two very real problems it needs to solve: economic and military security.","The tensions in Ukraine have become a challenge to sovereignty and self-determination.

"From this standpoint, Russia’s biggest concern is NATO. After the Cold War, the Baltic states declared their independence. In 2004 all three were admitted to NATO. This immediately raised an air of concern within the Russian government. However, these three nations don’t hold the same cultural significance that Ukraine does. Much of Russian culture stems from Kyiv. Additionally, the Ukrainian border is 460km from Moscow at its closest point. In the world of Air Defense systems, should Ukraine ever join NATO, that's a big problem if you are on the wrong side of a missile system.","From this standpoint, Russia’s biggest concern is NATO.

"“So what’s the secret behind [Slack](http://www.slack.com)? What did you guys do that was so special?” the voice crackled over my car’s Bluetooth, “I want you guys to do whatever you did for them.” I was on a call with a prospective client, the CEO of a successful SaaS app who wanted to hire us to redesign his product. I launched into a story that I’ve told hundreds of times.

I’ve been asked this question almost every day for the past year by clients, investors, and fellow designers trying to reverse engineer the secret behind Slack’s success. It seems like Slack is taking over the world these days, now sporting a mind-boggling $2.8 billion dollar valuation, hundreds of thousands of users, and a break-neck growth rate.","“So what’s the secret behind Slack?

"Figuring out why something is successful in retrospect is like trying to describe the taste of water. It’s _hard_. We aren’t big on process.

Slack was no different — there wasn’t any magic process we used — but looking back, I’ve identified a few key things that helped make it the huge success it’s become.

When you hear people talk about Slack they often say it’s “fun”. Using it doesn’t feel like work. It feels like _slacking_ _off_, even when you’re using it to get stuff done. But when you look under the hood, it’s almost identical to every other chat app. You can create a room, add people, share files, and chat as a group or direct message one another.

"As a kid, I used to love this burger chain called [White Spot](http://www.whitespot.ca). It started out as a tiny shack at a baseball stadium and over the past 85 years it has grown into a huge chain with locations all over Canada. The secret to its success? The “Triple-O” secret sauce that they put on all their burgers.

I used to bug my parents to let us go to White Spot instead of having another gross lovingly home-cooked meal. That is, until my Dad dropped a bomb on me. “We should just make burgers at home,” he said “you know that sauce is just mayonnaise, ketchup, and a bit of relish, right?” Sure enough, we made it at home, and confirmed that their so-called secret sauce was a bunch of grocery store condiments mixed together. Anyone could make it, but few people knew how or bothered. Instead they chalked it up to a some crazy secret recipe.","As a kid, I used to love this burger chain called White Spot.

"That simple action changed the way I looked at my ex wife. That constant reminder that I should forgive her, led me to accept the way things happened at the end of my marriage, and embrace a new way of dealing with the depression that I was drowning into.

"Seeing how these _reminders_ helped to materialize my goals kept me motivated and excited. I’ll admit this: It is _difficult_ to come up with your next goal. Sometimes it’s hard to identify what we need to change, or where we need to walk towards to.

**Make sure your goals are realistic**, and avoid being too dreamy when you phrase them. It’s important to build a _metric_ around your goal so you can measure its success along the way. For example, if you’re on a hunt to get a better job, don’t use things like _BeTh3NumberOne!_ but instead go with _KickASS@LinkedIn!_ and use the new connections, groups and number of resumes sent as a metric to validate your efforts to land a new job. Being the number one is great, but being able to measure _where you are_ and _where you’re going_ is important, specially when there’s a big gap between those two points.","Seeing how these reminders helped to materialize my goals kept me motivated and excited.

"**So why does this trick work?** In its simplest form, a password enables you to get somewhere, in your digital world. Say, to copy a file, to unlock a computer, to email somebody. This feeling of micro achievements, this thought of _‘my mantra helps me to get things done’_ can build up a momentum that motivates you to stay focused on achieving your monthly goals. It’s a tiny habit that has the power to transform.

It worked with me. I’m sure it will work with you.

This is how I learned that I can truly **change my life**, if I play it right. I kept doing this repeatedly month after month, with great results.

Here is a simplified extract of what some of my passwords have been in the last 2 years, so you get an idea of how my life has changed, thanks to this method:","So why does this trick work?

"Until July of 2014, I worked for Amazon. As a relatively successful young book editor, I’d been hired by the company in 2011 to help launch its New York City-based book publishing outpost created to commission original content by name writers. The media landscape was continuing to evolve; everyone was in everyone else’s lane. It was a big opportunity, one many people inside the publishing industry told me privately I would be crazy not to take. I was drawn to Amazon’s spirit of innovation, its agility, and its culture of excellence. I was about to start Columbia’s Executive MBA program when the offer came in. Why not, as the saying goes, “earn to learn,” I thought. I took the job.","Until July of 2014, I worked for Amazon.

"_Shadows are invaluable cues in telling the human brain what user interface elements we’re looking at._

This is perhaps the **most important non-obvious thing** to learn about UI design: _light comes from the sky._ Light comes from the sky so frequently and consistently that for it to come from below actually looks _freaky._

When light comes from the sky, it illuminates the tops of things and casts shadows below them. The tops of stuff are lighter, the bottoms are darker.

Well, the same is true for UI. Just as we have little shadows on all the undersides of all our facial features, there are shadows on the undersides of _tons_ of UI elements. **Our screens are flat, but we’ve invested a great amount of art into making so many elements on them _appear be 3-D_**.","Shadows are invaluable cues in telling the human brain what user interface elements we’re looking at.

"Take buttons. Even with this relatively “flat” button, there are still a handful of light-related details:

1.  The unpushed button (top) has a **darkened bottom edge**. Sun don’t shine there, son.
2.  The unpushed button is **slightly brighter at the top** than at the bottom. This is because it imitates a slightly curved surface. Just as how you’d need to tilt a mirror held in front of you up to see the sun in it, surfaces that are tilted up reflect a _biiiiit_ more of the sun’s light towards you.
3.  The unpushed button casts a **subtle shadow** – perhaps easier to see in the magnified section.

That was just a button, and yet there are these 4 little light effects present. That’s the lesson here. Now we just apply it to _everything._","Take buttons.

"Here is a pair of old iOS 6 settings — “Do Not Disturb” and “Notifications”. Look how many light effects are going on with them.

*   The top lip of the inset control panel casts a small shadow
*   The “ON” slider track is also immediately set in a bit
*   The “ON” slider track is concave and the bottom reflects more light

"_Designing in grayscale before adding color simplifies the most complex element of visual design– and forces you to focus on spacing and laying out elements._

UX designers are really into designing “mobile-first” these days. That means you think about how pages and interactions work on a phone _before_ imagining them on your zillion-pixel $6000 pro monitor.

And **that sort of constraint is great. It clarifies thinking**. You start with the harder problem (usable app on a teeny-weeny screen), then adopt the solution to the easier problem (usable app on a large screen).

Well here’s another similar constraint: design _black and white first_. Start with the harder problem of making the app beautiful and usable in every way, but without the aid of color. **Add color last, and even then, only with purpose**.","Designing in grayscale before adding color simplifies the most complex element of visual design– and forces you to focus on spacing and laying out elements.

"1.  **It’s _not_ note taking**: Don’t think, just because you write down everything in a meeting, that you’re excused from the 30 second summation. Though brief, this exercise is entirely different from taking notes. It’s an act of interpretation, prioritisation and decision-making.
2.  **It’s hard work:** Deciding what’s most important is exhausting. It’s amazing how easy it is to tell yourself you’ve captured everything that matters, to find excuses to avoid this brief mental sprint — a kind of 100 metres for your brain.
3.  **Detail is a trap:** Precisely because we so often, ostensibly, capture everything, we avoid the hard work of deciding what few things count. So much of excellence is, of course, the art of elimination. And the 30 second review stops you using quantity as an excuse.
4.  **You must act quickly:** If you wait a few hours, you may recall the facts, but you lose the nuance. And this makes all the difference in deciding what matters. Whether it’s the tone in someone’s voice, or the way one seemingly simple suggestion sparks so many others, or the shadow of an idea in your mind triggered by a passing comment.
5.  **You learn to listen better, and ask better questions:** Once you get into the habit of the 30 second review, it starts to change the way you pay attention, whether listening to a talk or participating in a discussion. It’s like learning to detect a simple melody amidst a cacophony of sound. And as you listen with more focus, and ask better questions which prompt actionable answers, so your 30 second review becomes more useful.
6.  **You’re able to help others more:** Much of what makes the 30 second cut are observations about what matters to _other_ people. Even if the purpose is to help better manage different interests in future conversations, it also helps you understand others’ needs, and so solve their problems. This does not surprise me: in months of interviewing people who make generous connections, I’ve been struck by how many have their own unconscious version of the 30 second review: focused on the question of how best they can help.
7.  **It gets easier and more valuable:** Each time you practice, it gets a little easier, a little more helpful, and little more fun.","It’s not note taking: Don’t think, just because you write down everything in a meeting, that you’re excused from the 30 second summation.

"Previously, interfaces were centered around the principle of skeumorphism, a design principle that takes cues from original structures or objects (_for example, digital calendar resembling a paper desk calendar, 3D ‘depth’ on app icons, the shutter click sound of a mobile phone_). Now that flat design has shifted away from this principle, it opens up the opportunity to create depth in new ways. Primarily, using layers helps create this feeling of depth and dimension, creating a more ‘tangible’ experience.","Previously, interfaces were centered around the principle of skeumorphism, a design principle that takes cues from original structures or objects (for example, digital calendar resembling a paper desk calendar, 3D ‘depth’ on app icons, the shutter click sound of a mobile phone).

"An implication of flat design was the risk of being ‘too flat’ — with so much subtlety, how can the user navigate and engage, given their conditioning to a 3D physical (_and previously digital_) world? Layers provide the ability to show one item is on top of another by taking full advantage of the z-axis. Layering and increasing depth helps identify the relationship between different items, and draws attention to certain items.","An implication of flat design was the risk of being ‘too flat’ — with so much subtlety, how can the user navigate and engage, given their conditioning to a 3D physical (and previously digital) world?

"Actually, I believe I would have been _more_ effective: a better leader and a more focused employee. I would have had fewer panic attacks, and acute health problems — like throwing out my back regularly in my early 20s. I would have picked fewer petty fights with my peers in the organization, because I would have been generally more centered and self-reflective. I would have been less frustrated and resentful when things went wrong, and required me to put in even more hours to deal with a local crisis. In short, I would have had more energy and spent it in smarter ways… AND I would have been happier. That’s why this is a true regret for me: I don’t feel like I chose between two worthy outcomes. No, I made a foolish sacrifice on both sides.","Actually, I believe I would have been more effective: a better leader and a more focused employee.

"The research is clear: beyond ~40–50 hours per week, the marginal returns from additional work decrease rapidly and quickly become negative. We have also demonstrated that though you can get more output for a few weeks during “crunch time” you still ultimately pay for it later when people inevitably need to recover. If you try to sustain crunch time for longer than that, you are merely creating the illusion of increased velocity.

"Why are companies doing this? It must be some combination of 1/ not knowing the research 2/ believing the research is somehow flawed or doesn’t apply to them (they’re wrong) or 3/ understanding that many people see these cultural artifacts as a signal about the intensity and passion of the team. I believe it is a combination of all three factors, and the third one resonates particularly strongly with me. We’ve worked hard to build a culture at Asana where people don’t work _too_ hard, but we sometimes have candidates tell us they are worried that means we don’t move fast enough, or have enough urgency. I’m not sure what I would do if I thought these values were actually in conflict, but fortunately they are not. We get to encourage a healthy work-life balance in the cold, hard pursuit of profit. We are maximizing our velocity and our happiness at the same time.","Why are companies doing this?

"What is one thing most successful people have in common? They get up extra early and make the most of the morning. Here’s why:

Waking up early gives you time to think before the buzz of the day begins. To put it simply, the early morning is “you time” — a time to lay out your priorities for the day and make progress against them, before others are demanding your time and attention. It puts you firmly in control of each day.

Of course it is awfully hard to get out of bed, but that’s exactly why early risers have the competitive advantage over everyone else. They tackle the day while others hit the snooze button.

In addition to the overall health and fitness benefits, studies have shown that moderate-intensity exercise for 20+ minutes produces a mental and emotional boost for the following 12 hours! This means that these business leaders are likely more clear-headed, effective, and productive at work as a direct result of their morning workout. The exercise time also allows them to think and problem-solve without interruption, so they hit the ground running once they get into the office. Morning exercise is an incredibly efficient use of time.

"Last year, I read four books.

The reasons for that low number are, I guess, the same as your reasons for reading fewer books than you think you should have read last year: I’ve been finding it harder and harder to concentrate on words, sentences, paragraphs. Let alone chapters. Chapters often have page after page of paragraphs. It just seems such an awful lot of words to concentrate on, on their own, without something else happening. And once you’ve finished one chapter, you have to get through another one. And usually a whole bunch more, before you can say _finished_, and get to the next. The next book. The next thing. The next possibility. Next next next.","Last year, I read four books.

"It takes a long time to read a book at four sentences per day.

And it’s exhausting. I was usually asleep halfway through sentence number five.

I’ve noticed this pattern of behaviour for a while now, but I think last year’s completed book tally was as low as it has ever been. It was dispiriting, most deeply so because my professional life revolves around books: I started [LibriVox](http://librivox.org) (free public domain audiobooks), and [Pressbooks](http://pressbooks.com) (an online platform for making print and ebooks), and I co-edited a [book about the future of books.](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Futurists-Manifesto-Collection-Publishing/dp/1449305601)

I’ve dedicated my life one way or another to books, I _believe_ in them, yet, I wasn’t able to read them.

"What was true of my problems reading books — the unavoidable siren call of the digital hit of new information — was true in the rest of my life as well.

My two-year old daughter, dance recital. Pink tutu. Cat ears on her head. Along with five other two-year-olds, in front of a crowd of 75 parents and grandparents, these little toddlers put on a show. You can imagine the rest. You’ve seen these videos on Youtube, maybe I have shown you my videos. The cuteness level was extreme, a moment that defines a certain kind of parental pride. My daughter didn’t even dance, she just wandered around the stage, looking at the audience with eyes as wide as a two-year old’s eyes starting at a bunch of strangers. It didn’t matter that she didn’t dance, I was so proud. I took photos, and video, with my phone.

And, just in case, I checked my email. Twitter. You never know.","What was true of my problems reading books — the unavoidable siren call of the digital hit of new information — was true in the rest of my life as well.

"I find myself in these kinds of situations often, checking email or Twitter, or Facebook, with nothing to gain except the stress of a work-related message that I can’t answer right now in any case.

It makes me feel vaguely dirty, reading my phone with my daughter doing something wonderful right next to me, like I’m sneaking a cigarette.

Or a crack pipe.

One time I was reading on my phone while my older daughter, the four-year-old, was trying to talk to me. I didn’t quite hear what she had said, and in any case, I was reading an article about North Korea. She grabbed my face in her two hands, pulled me towards her. “Look at me,” she said, “when I’m talking to you.”

She is right. I should.

Spending time with friends, or family, I often feel a soul-deep throb coming from that perfectly engineered wafer of stainless steel and glass and rare earth metals in my pocket. _Touch me. Look at me. You might find something marvellous._","I find myself in these kinds of situations often, checking email or Twitter, or Facebook, with nothing to gain except the stress of a work-related message that I can’t answer right now in any case.

"Email, of course, is the worst, because email is where work happens, and even if it’s not the _work you should be doing right now_ it may well be work that’s easier to do than what you are doing now, and that means somehow you end up doing that work instead of whatever you are supposed to be working on now.

"It turns out that digital devices and software are finely tuned to train us to pay attention to them, no matter what else we should be doing. The mechanism, borne out by recent neuroscience studies, is something like this:

*   _New information creates a rush of dopamine to the brain, a neurotransmitter that makes you feel good._
*   _The promise of new information compels your brain to seek out that dopamine rush._

With fMRIs, you can see the brain’s pleasure centres light up with activity when new emails arrive.","It turns out that digital devices and software are finely tuned to train us to pay attention to them, no matter what else we should be doing.

"So, every new email you get gives you a little flood of dopamine. Every little flood of dopamine reinforces your brain’s memory that checking email gives a flood of dopamine. And our brains are programmed to seek out things that will give us little floods of dopamine. Further, these patterns of behaviour start creating neural pathways, so that they become unconscious habits: Work on something important, brain itch, check email, _dopamine_, refresh, _dopamine_, check Twitter, _dopamine_, back to work. Over and over, and each time the habit becomes more ingrained in the actual structures of our brains.

"There is a famous study of rats, wired up with electrodes on their brains. When the rats press a lever, a little charge gets released in part of their brain that stimulates dopamine release. A pleasure lever.

Given a choice between food and dopamine, they’ll take the dopamine, often up to the point of exhaustion and starvation. They’ll take the dopamine over sex. Some studies see the rats pressing the dopamine lever 700 times in an hour.

"When I think back on my life, I can define a set of books that shaped me — intellectually, emotionally, spiritually.

"Books, in ways that are different to visual art, to music, to radio, to love even, force us to walk through another’s thoughts, one word at a time, over hours and days. We share our minds for that time with the writer’s. There is a slowness, a forced reflection required by the medium that is unique. Books recreate someone else’s thoughts inside our own minds, and maybe it is this one-to-one mapping of someone else’s words, on their own, without external stimuli, that give books their power. Books force us to let someone else’s thoughts inhabit our minds completely.

Books are not just transferrers of knowledge and emotion, but a special kind of tool that flattens one self into another, that enable the trying-on of foreign ideas and emotions.","Books, in ways that are different to visual art, to music, to radio, to love even, force us to walk through another’s thoughts, one word at a time, over hours and days.

"This suppressing of the self is a kind of meditation too — and while books have always been important to me on their own (pre-digital) merits, it started to occur to me that “learning how to read books again,” might also be a way to start weaning my mind away from this dopamine-soaked digital detritus, this meaningless wash of digital information, which would have a double benefit: I would be reading books again, and I would get my mind back.

1.  No more Twitter, Facebook, or article reading during the work day (hard)
2.  No reading of random news articles (hard)
3.  No smartphones or computers in the bedroom (easy)
4.  No TV after dinner (it turns out, easy)

"Around me, I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I’d been used to. An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with. New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs. Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you.

Two weeks later, I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. I called it [_Ketabkhan_](http://blogs.tarjomaan.com/books/) — it means book-reader in Persian.","Around me, I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I’d been used to.

"Six years was a long time to be in jail, but it’s an entire era online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but _reading_ — or, at least, getting things read — had altered dramatically. I’d been told how essential social networks had become while I’d been gone, and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now.

So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn’t care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. No description. No image. Nothing. It got three likes. Three! That was it.

It became clear to me, right there, that things had changed. I was not equipped to play on this new turf — all my investment and effort had burned up.

"The hyperlink was my currency six years ago. Stemming from the idea of the [hypertext](http://www.cyberartsweb.org/cpace/ht/htov.html), the hyperlink provided a diversity and decentralisation that the real world lacked. The hyperlink represented the open, interconnected spirit of the world wide web — a vision that started with its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee. The hyperlink was a way to abandon centralization — all the links, lines and hierarchies — and replace them with something more distributed, a system of nodes and networks.

Blogs gave form to that spirit of decentralization: They were _windows_ into lives you’d rarely know much about; _bridges_ that connected different lives to each other and thereby changed them. Blogs were _cafes_ where people exchanged diverse ideas on any and every topic you could possibly be interested in. They were Tehran’s taxicabs writ large.

Since I got out of jail, though, I’ve realized how much the hyperlink has been devalued, almost made obsolete.","The hyperlink was my currency six years ago.

"Nearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any other object — the same as a photo, or a piece of text — instead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer. You’re encouraged to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting: Adding several links to a piece of text is usually not allowed.

"At the same time, these social networks tend to treat native text and pictures — things that are directly posted to them — with a lot more respect than those that reside on outside web pages. One photographer friend explained to me how the images he uploads directly to Facebook receive a large number of likes, which in turn means they appear more on other people’s news feeds. On the other hand, when he posts a link to the same picture somewhere outside Facebook — his now-dusty blog, for instance — the images are much less visible to Facebook itself, and therefore get far fewer likes.

"Some networks, like Twitter, treat hyperlinks a little better. Others, insecure social services, are far more paranoid. Instagram — owned by Facebook — doesn’t allow its audiences to leave whatsoever. You can put up a web address alongside your photos, but it won’t go anywhere. Lots of people start their daily online routine in these cul de sacs of social media, and their journeys end there.

It’s just an app.

But hyperlinks aren’t just the skeleton of the web: They are its eyes, a path to its soul. And a blind webpage, one without hyperlinks, can’t look or gaze at another webpage — and this has serious consequences for the dynamics of power on the web.","Some networks, like Twitter, treat hyperlinks a little better.

"More or less, all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power, and mostly in a negative sense: the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object, devoid of intelligence or agency. But in the world of webpages, gaze functions differently: It is more empowering. When a powerful website — say Google or Facebook — gazes at, or links to, another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it — it brings it into existence; gives it life. Metaphorically, without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe. No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it, it is actually both dead _and_ blind; and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.

On the other hand, the most powerful web pages are those that have many eyes upon them. Just like celebrities who draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing at them any given time, web pages can capture and distribute their power through hyperlinks.","More or less, all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power, and mostly in a negative sense: the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object, devoid of intelligence or agency.

In the past, the web was powerful and serious enough to land me in jail. Today it feels like little more than entertainment. So much that even Iran doesn’t take some — Instagram, for instance — serious enough to block. I miss when people took time to be exposed to different opinions, and bothered to read more than a paragraph or 140 characters. I miss the days when I could write something on my own blog, publish on my own domain, without taking an equal time to promote it on numerous social networks; when nobody cared about likes and reshares.

"Books suck. No question about it, almost everyone who writes a book is a crappy writer.

And this is a good thing.

It’s because the writer spent his life getting GOOD at what he was writing about. He didn’t spend his life being good at writing.

He didn’t spend his life typing. He ran a country. Or built a robot. Or discovered DNA or walked between the twin towers.

He or She DID something. Something that changed lives. Something that went from his or her head out into the real world.

But that’s ok. There are a few good books out there.

I like reading billion-person books. Books, that if read widely, would change a billion lives.

I like reading books where I feel my brain have an IQ orgasm. Like, I literally feel my IQ go up while reading the book.

And, (please let me stick with this metaphor one more sentence), I might have a little brain-child that turns into my own special idea or book after reading a great book.","Books suck.

"Before I give my list, I want to mention there are three kinds of non-fiction books: (and I’m only dealing with non-fiction. Fiction is another category).

**\- BUSINESS CARD BOOKS:**

These are books like “How to be a leader”.

They establish the author as an expert. The author then uses this book to get speaking gigs or coaching or consulting gigs.

These books usually suck. Don’t read one. But nothing wrong with writing one.

In fact, writing one might be desperately important to your career.

**\- BOOKS THAT SHOULD BE CHAPTERS:**

A publisher will see an article somewhere like, “12 ways to become smarter” and say, “that should be a book”.

Then the writer mistakenly says, “ok” and he has to undergo the agony of changing something that was a perfectly good 2000 word article into a 60,000 word book.

Those books suck. Don’t read one. And DEFINITELY don’t write one. Unless you want to waste a year of your life. I wasted 2004–2009 doing that.

"Stationed on the West Coast of the United States, flanked by the blue hues of the Pacific Ocean, is a city that’s home to some of the greatest companies in the world. 700 miles south of that is San Francisco.

I moved to San Francisco two years ago to work for a startup called [Padlet](https://padlet.com). I love it here. It’s like being in Hollywood, but with less-good-looking people. You have the celebs, you have the scandals, you have the media frenzy. My friends back home are full of questions:

_“Is it fun?”_

_“You think I should look for a job there?”_

_“How far is Vegas?”_

So, here is my experience. I hope it brings the readers closer to our little valley where we are building the future. _(Hint: About 145 different companies will be solving food transportation.)_","Stationed on the West Coast of the United States, flanked by the blue hues of the Pacific Ocean, is a city that’s home to some of the greatest companies in the world. 700 miles south of that is San Francisco.

"My day begins with a 30 minute commute to work. I take the subway. The subway system in SF is called BART, short for Bay Area Rapid _(Hahahahaa .. Hahahahaaa)_ Transit. I love BART because it is always full of surprises. E.g. yesterday, I was at the train station and bam! the train came on time.

Many drive to work. Driving in SF is like a theme park ride — the cars move bumper to bumper, the terrain is alpine, and the people around you have the temper of 10-year-olds.

"Those with a death wish cycle to work. It is easy to spot a cyclist. If you see a guy with one side of his jeans rolled up to the shin, he is a moron; if you see a guy on a bicycle, he is a cyclist.

My office is in a neighbourhood called SoMa, short for South of Market. Many startup offices are in SoMa. The name is a tribute to the returns that investors in these startups will see in the long run. (N.B. Padlet has since moved to the [Presidio](https://padl.et/sf) neighbourhood.)

SoMa is a vibrant area with a variety of establishments like Starbucks, local coffeeshops, grab-and-go coffee kiosks, and coffee trucks. It’s a shame I don’t drink coffee. It’s not that I don’t like the beverage. I just prefer not to consume anything at temperatures that would liquify my alimentary canal.

Why is coffee in SF so hot? Are people welding metal with it? The one time I asked a barista (phrased more politely, of course), I was reproached,

"Odd! Good bread needs to be baked at 400°F but I don’t see any bakeries selling me searing dough bricks.

My company shares its office with two other companies — [Buildzoom](http://buildzoom.com) and [Flexport](http://flexport.com). Judging from their names, Buildzoom manufactures high precision microscopes and Flexport ships fluorine to dentists in China. We all have a common investor named YC. YC is the venture capital arm of the YMCA. They invest in a lot of companies every year, many that seem outrageous on paper. E.g. they invested in a company called [Swapbox](http://swapbox.com), which, I believe, is cloud storage for swingers.

Now, you must be thinking — _“Isn’t it stupid to judge a company by its name?”_ No. It’s not. Most companies in the Bay Area have obvious names:

*   Evernote makes note taking apps
*   Optimizely lets you optimize your websites

"Our office, like most modern startup offices, has an open floor plan. In an open floor plan, desks are organised like tables in a college cafeteria. However, instead of food and noise, you have computers, food, and noise.

The noise mandates that you wear headphones while working. Be careful, though. Your choice of headphones reveals a lot about your character:

*   **Beats headphones:** You are wasting your life’s earnings on fashion, hopelessly trying to look like a cool teenager.
*   **Headphones that come with your phone:** You value a simple life. Buddha smiles on you.
*   **Giant noise cancelling headphones resembling electric shock equipment:** You are Chuck Norris.

An assorted collection of desks and chairs adorns our office. People reflected on their lack of fitness and concluded that the blame lay squarely on their choice of furniture. So some people have standing desks — desks so high that you have to stand to use them (or as short folks like myself like to call them, any other desks).","Our office, like most modern startup offices, has an open floor plan.

"Markets are chockablock with these desk+gym hybrids — standing desks, treadmill desks, cycling desks. This is why I feel bullish about my swimming desk idea — a big water tank with an infinity pool and a computer bolted on one side. Noise cancelling scuba masks, snorkels, and fins come as standard equipment.

My favourite mutant furniture, however, is the “balancing ball chair”. This chair has an exercise ball in place of a seat cushion. Let me repeat that: in place of a seat cushion, this chair has, a giant ball. It’s a great way to lose weight _(Pronounced: ˈdiɡnədē)_.","Markets are chockablock with these desk+gym hybrids — standing desks, treadmill desks, cycling desks.

"Most startups provide lunch. Given the wide array of dietary preferences people have in SF, it’s a tricky proposition. It is fairly common to have someone who is a vegetarian, a vegan, on gluten-free, on paleo, and on juice detox in an office of 3 people. Allow me to explain these diets:

*   **Vegetarians** don’t eat meat. I like vegetarians. I take comfort in the fact that if I am stranded with them in the Atlantic, ethically, I am one step closer to eating them than they are to eating me.
*   **Vegans** don’t use anything that comes from animals — like milk, leather, meat, and Comcast.
*   **Gluten-free** people don’t eat glue, which is a stupid diet to be on because no rational person eats glue. Based on that logic, I am on a painten-free diet because I don’t eat paint.
*   People on **paleo** only eat foods available to paleolithic humans, like Mammoths and Megalodon sharks.
*   **Juice detoxers** eat other people’s neurons because they don’t shut up about being on juice detox.","Most startups provide lunch.

"This is why our first hire was a lousy mountain climber.

One last thing — the startup life does not stop at work; it affects your personal life too. E.g., if you work at a startup in San Francisco, you are like the guy selling plastic souvenirs at the Eiffel tower. Everyone at the Eiffel tower is selling plastic souvenirs. So you find yourself having the same conversations with similar people. Here is an example:

**Alex**: I have a startup. We are Yelp for contractors.  
**Ben**: I have a startup too. We are contractors for Yelp.

**Together**: Business model … yada yada yada [Paul Graham](http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/p/paul-graham) … [Series A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A) … lorem ipsum Google sucks.

This, in itself, is not a problem; I enjoy these conversations. The problem is that they often render you incapable of any other forms of communication.

Animation is all about timing. You can play with all sorts of different spacing to get different results. But enough about that. This isn’t an animation tutorial, the point was to get you thinking about the language of timing and spacing.","Look at that! You just learned about cushioning/easing.

"1.  **Keep _it_ in your pants.** This is an obvious one. It’s rare that you need to use your phone (or genitals for that matter) when in a social setting. There are obvious exceptions like your group needs directions or you want a reasonable amount of photos of a once-in-a-lifetime event (weddings, baby’s first steps). Brunches and sunsets happen every day. No need to miss the actual experience by snapping 5,000 pictures of it. Respecting these limits will enrich every interaction you have with every day objects, people, and life. If you feel the itch to pull out your phone in a break in the conversation…‘silence’ it. Undoubtedly your friends will whip theirs out, making the temptation almost unbearable. If you want to truly cleanse, this step is unbreakable. You can also influence your friends’ behaviors by playfully shaming them when they pull out their phones unnecessarily (‘Oh hey Hollywood!’). To get started with this one, I instructed my friends to punch my arm if I broke this rule in their presence. I adapted quickly. The _itch_ soon decreased. Slowly at first, but after a few days of withdrawal it was completely gone. I no longer relied on my phone to solve any anxiety or unnecessary emptiness. I was human again.
2.  **Brain first, phone second.** Can’t think of the artist for a song you just heard? Siri can’t help you now. Exercise your brain, and try to figure it out for yourself. If you still can’t get it after a few minutes of focus, shift your attention to something else and it will come to you sooner than later. Be sure to carry a notepad (that’s right…actual pen and paper) to jot it down so worst case you can Google it later.
3.  **Hide and delete.** This is the mobile cleanse mantra. Say it with me now… “Hummmmmmm…hide (inhale)…and delete (exhale)…and hide (inhale)…and delete (exhale).” You don’t need 200 apps. Uninstall the ones you no longer use and tuck the non-essentials into folders a few swipes from your main screen so it’s inconvenient to access them. You’ll soon realize how little you actually need them. My essentials include: phone, text, Spotify (music is my guilty pleasure. I’m not perfect), and Wunderlist (I’m a big fan of sole-focus task management…more on that in a second).
4.  **Never push. Always pull.** Unless your wife is expecting a baby at any minute, there’s nothing more important than the people you are with in that moment. Turn **_ALL_** notifications & badges off. Set your phone to silent (not _VIBRATE_). Don’t even allow yourself the temptation to swipe and catch up on the latest insta-snap-vine-whatsapp-videos. Don’t take away from the beautiful, seemingly insignificant, uninstagrammable moment you are having with the people you love. These nasty notifications also distract you from work, hobbies, and passions. Keep your focus. Buzzfeed’s top 25 beach bodies can wait. When mobile browsing is acceptable, **_PULL_** the information you seek (manual refresh, etc). Don’t let it come to you. Cold turkey. No exceptions.
5.  **Your delivery is free if it’s a mile or less.** Never Uber / Lyft / Sidecar if your destination is < 1mile. If weather and conditions permit, you can walk. Walk to the corner store for groceries. Get out of your house and and enjoy the fresh air (10 bonus points if you get to your destination without taking a picture. 20 points if you can walk without music. Another 50 points if you don’t need Google Maps to get there).
6.  **Buy a watch.** I would often catch myself pulling out my phone to merely check the time (and then check the time again since I never actually remembered it the first time). This frequent ‘time check’ reenforced the habit of constantly pulling out my phone and undoubtedly led to unnecessary browsing if a waiting notification piqued my interest. Buy a watch. Wear it.
7.  **No phones in the bedroom or bathroom.** Let’s focus on the bathroom first and [how much time you save](https://medium.com/) without your phone (see below for a non-scientific study of time spent on the toilet with and without a phone each day). Also the risk of accidentally dropping your iPhone in the toilet shoots dangerously close to zero if toilet tapping isn’t allowed. Now for the bedroom. It’s proven that [looking at bright screens](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/133/088/2320c993_92f3_b20b.jpg) just before bed increases the time it takes to fall asleep. Step 1 ABSOLUTELY applies in the bedroom. Imagine two star-crossed lovers staring deeply into eachothers’ phablets. Playfully destroying pigs or experiencing mind-numbing insta-gasms. Yeah you get the point. If there’s one experience I don’t want to miss for a new LinkedIn connection, it’s one where I can truly connect with the person I love.","Keep it in your pants. This is an obvious one. It’s rare that you need to use your phone (or genitals for that matter) when in a social setting. There are obvious exceptions like your group needs directions or you want a reasonable amount of photos of a once-in-a-lifetime event (weddings, baby’s first steps). Brunches and sunsets happen every day. No need to miss the actual experience by snapping 5,000 pictures of it. Respecting these limits will enrich every interaction you have with every day objects, people, and life. If you feel the itch to pull out your phone in a break in the conversation…‘silence’ it. Undoubtedly your friends will whip theirs out, making the temptation almost unbearable. If you want to truly cleanse, this step is unbreakable. You can also influence your friends’ behaviors by playfully shaming them when they pull out their phones unnecessarily (‘Oh hey Hollywood!’). To get started with this one, I instructed my friends to punch my arm if I broke this rule in their presence. I adapted quickly. The itch soon decreased. Slowly at first, but after a few days of withdrawal it was completely gone. I no longer relied on my phone to solve any anxiety or unnecessary emptiness. I was human again. 2. Brain first, phone second. Can’t think of the artist for a song you just heard? Siri can’t help you now. Exercise your brain, and try to figure it out for yourself. If you still can’t get it after a few minutes of focus, shift your attention to something else and it will come to you sooner than later. Be sure to carry a notepad (that’s right…actual pen and paper) to jot it down so worst case you can Google it later. 3. Hide and delete. This is the mobile cleanse mantra. Say it with me now… “Hummmmmmm…hide (inhale)…and delete (exhale)…and hide (inhale)…and delete (exhale).” You don’t need 200 apps. Uninstall the ones you no longer use and tuck the non-essentials into folders a few swipes from your main screen so it’s inconvenient to access them. You’ll soon realize how little you actually need them. My essentials include: phone, text, Spotify (music is my guilty pleasure. I’m not perfect), and Wunderlist (I’m a big fan of sole-focus task management…more on that in a second). 4. Never push. Always pull. Unless your wife is expecting a baby at any minute, there’s nothing more important than the people you are with in that moment. Turn ALL notifications & badges off. Set your phone to silent (not VIBRATE). Don’t even allow yourself the temptation to swipe and catch up on the latest insta-snap-vine-whatsapp-videos. Don’t take away from the beautiful, seemingly insignificant, uninstagrammable moment you are having with the people you love. These nasty notifications also distract you from work, hobbies, and passions. Keep your focus. Buzzfeed’s top 25 beach bodies can wait. When mobile browsing is acceptable, PULL the information you seek (manual refresh, etc). Don’t let it come to you. Cold turkey. No exceptions. 5. Your delivery is free if it’s a mile or less. Never Uber / Lyft / Sidecar if your destination is < 1mile. If weather and conditions permit, you can walk. Walk to the corner store for groceries. Get out of your house and and enjoy the fresh air (10 bonus points if you get to your destination without taking a picture. 20 points if you can walk without music. Another 50 points if you don’t need Google Maps to get there). 6. Buy a watch. I would often catch myself pulling out my phone to merely check the time (and then check the time again since I never actually remembered it the first time). This frequent ‘time check’ reenforced the habit of constantly pulling out my phone and undoubtedly led to unnecessary browsing if a waiting notification piqued my interest. Buy a watch. Wear it. 7. No phones in the bedroom or bathroom. Let’s focus on the bathroom first and how much time you save without your phone (see below for a non-scientific study of time spent on the toilet with and without a phone each day).

I needed to work smarter, not harder, and the first step was to create good habits."," A morning routine sets the tone for the whole day, and if you do each day right, you'll do life right.","**A morning routine sets the tone for the whole day, and if you do each day right, you'll do life right.**"
"**The first thing I needed to do was quit the belief that I was a “night owl.”**

Over the past several months I have been working on “habit stacking” to craft myself a good morning routine that works for me. Habit Stacking is a way to build a new habit into your life by stacking it on top of something you’re currently doing. For example, before I brush my teeth in the morning (current habit) I will meditate (new habit) for 3 minutes. I’ve discovered the personal ritual I have set up for myself has helped put me in the right mindset and offset any morning procrastination. Here’s a [previous medium post](https://medium.com/life-learning/what-stephen-curry-can-teach-us-about-creating-successful-habits-ed307dd7561f) I wrote about it.

Another great reason to create a morning ritual it is to avoid mental fatigue.","The first thing I needed to do was quit the belief that I was a “night owl.” Over the past several months I have been working on “habit stacking” to craft myself a good morning routine that works for me.

"**More grains of salt:** The chart above — and a lot of the comparisons you read in the press about web site traffic — are based on Comscore’s numbers and only count U.S. users. Two big problems with this: 1) Most site operators will tell you their numbers vary greatly from Comscore’s. The smaller a site is, the more likely this is true (due to their sampling method). Although, Comscore will tell you that’s because they filter out duplicate users. 2) A small portion of total Internet users are in the U.S. Every site is global — but to very different degrees. So without a disclaimer that we’re only interested in the U.S., only showing U.S. numbers could be highly misleading.

(Twitter is as much utility as media and part of its benefit is being incredibly concise — plus, a lot of its purpose, like Google, is to point people off to other places.

"There was a time, in fact, when that was more the case. In earlier web times page views were talked about at least as much as unique visitors. But that became obsolete and meaningless (as “hits” had before that) even before the rise of apps made that abundantly clear.

While page views just became silly, for technical reasons, the MAU/UV emphasis feels toxic.

If what you care about — or are trying to report on — is impact on the world, it all gets very slippery. You’re not measuring a rectangle, you’re measuring a multi-dimensional space.

"The best — maybe the only? — real, direct measure of “innovation” is change in human behaviour. In fact, it is useful to take this way of thinking as definitional: innovation _is_ the sum of change across the whole system, not a thing which _causes_ a change in how people behave. No small innovation ever caused a large shift in how people spend their time and no large one has ever failed to do so.

By that measure, Slack is a real and large innovation. It is not as eye-catching as self-driving cars or implantable chips — it is not basic research-y kind of stuff. But, for organizations that adopt it, there will be a dramatic shift in how time is spent, how communication happens, and how the team’s archives are utilized.

"This isn’t a new idea. There are many brands whose marketing activities or positioning has them selling something other than (and usually larger than) their product: Harley Davidson sells motorcycle riding, but it especially sells freedom and independence. Most luxury brands sell something that comes down to “being better than you are” (richer, better looking, more attractive to those you find desirable, etc.)

My favorite recent example is Lululemon: when they started, there was not a large market for yoga-specific athletic wear and accessories. They sold yoga like crazy: helping people find yoga studios near their homes, hosting free classes, sponsorships and scholarships, local ambassadors and training, etc. And as a result, they sold just under $1.4 billion worth of yoga-specific athletic wear and accessories in their most recent fiscal year.","This isn’t a new idea.

"But going back to the Acme Saddle Company, the better analogy to what we are doing now is to imagine them selling horseback riding … about 4,000 years ago. It is almost inevitable that centralized internal communication systems will gradually replace email for most organizations over the next 10-20 years and we should do what we can to accelerate the trend and “own it”. We are at the beginning of a transition. We have an opportunity to both define the category and push hard for the whole market’s growth.

It was mediocre because it was nearly 70 pages when it could have been 20, not because the ideas were bad: in fact, the core ideas of the piece are fascinating and, I think, very useful to us as we think about the next year or so of Slack.

A central thesis is that _all products are asking things of their customers_: to do things in a certain way, to think of themselves in a certain way — and usually that means changing what one does or how one does it; it often means changing how one thinks of oneself.","A few months ago, I read a fairly mediocre ebook called “Who Do You Want Your Customers to Become?” (available here).

Every bit of grace, refinement, and thoughtfulness on our part will pull people along. Every petty irritation will stop them and give the impression that it is not worth it.

"But Slack is a bit more complicated than a restaurant (at least in some ways). Since it is new and less familiar, we are less able to fall back on well-established best practices.

"We found that billion dollar consumer companies generally reinvent existing behavior with a superior consumer experience, rather than bringing something radical and novel to the market.

Companies like Nextdoor, Square, Zulily, and others have given consumers new ways to do things they were already doing — connecting with neighbors, paying with credit cards, and buying kids products online. Each company’s success stemmed from a unique insight it had about the customer that spawned a better experience.

Dropbox was just easier to use than other backup/storage/sync solutions, and far better than the USB drive/self-email status quo.

"Another interesting finding is that many of the billion dollar companies were not monetizing their customers at the time of their Series A round, including Twitter, Pinterest, Houzz, and Nextdoor. At this stage, they were focused on building a user base rather than making money. These startups first focused on nailing their customer proposition and increasing adoption and engagement. Once they had established themselves firmly in the market and reached massive scale, then they started to think about revenue.

While most companies did not have revenue early on, we found that many that grow to significant scale did have signs of strong product/market fit and/or exhibited strong network effects by their Series A round.

"The core user experience is not a set of features; in fact, it is the job users hire the product for. Uber’s core user experience is to get a taxi easily at any time. The countdown, displaying when exactly the taxi will arrive, is a suitable feature that expands this experience. But Uber’s product works regardless of this feature. The countdown, on the other hand, cannot live without the product (the certainty to get a taxi easily at any time).

Uber’s core user experience is to get a taxi easily at any time. The countdown, displaying when exactly the taxi will arrive, is a suitable feature that expands this experience.

"A product has a core user experience, which is basically the reason the product exists. It fulfills a need or solves a problem people have. By that, it becomes meaningful and provides a certain value. If the problem is non-existant, or the solution doesn’t fit to the problem, the product becomes meaningless and people won’t use the product; which in turn leads to the downfall of the product. Wrong solutions can be fixed, but non-existant problems aren’t adjustable at all. So, how can we be sure to tackle a real problem? Alas, we can‘t be 100% sure, but we can minimize the risk a lot by observing and talking to people. Hence, uncovering the problem and building solutions customers really want.

"Clay Christensen, for instance, once tried to improve the sales of milkshakes. He tried to make them sweeter, offered them in different tastes, and slightly increased the size of the cups. Nothing worked out, until he started observing the customers who bought milkshakes. He found out that the job the customers hired the milkshake for was in fact to make their morning car ride to work less boring. The big benefit a milkshake has is that it is a thick drink that lasts longer than any other drink and stuffs the stomach. This was the real problem; the customers had no idea about it. In the end Christensen came up with the solution to make the milkshake even thicker, which led to an increase in sales numbers. [http://ipony.de/?p=3495](http://ipony.de/?p=3495])

"Products become meaningful when the provided solution fits the uncovered problem. This solution describes the way how a problem will be solved. Thus, the problem-solution-fit defines the core user experience of a product. The concrete features are extending this experience and support the core experience, but they cannot replace it.

"Product Thinking enables UX designers to ask the right questions, to build the right features and to communicate with stakeholders more efficiently. It enables designers to say „no“ and to be hesitant before adding new features. Whenever a new feature is requested or someone has an idea for a new product, designers are able to ask the right questions, before drawing wireframes or crafting fancy layouts: “Does it fit into the product?”–“Does it serve a real user problem?” –“Do people want or need it?–Let’s find out first!” This will keep the product slim and effective.","Product Thinking enables UX designers to ask the right questions, to build the right features and to communicate with stakeholders more efficiently.

And yet, we failed.

We did lots of things right and lots of things wrong at Sonar.

"We launched Sonar with Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare support. Shortly thereafter, users buffeted us with requests for Linkedin integration. Ostensibly, they wanted to use the app to meet fellow professionals.

Eager to please, we rushed to add Linkedin. The net effect? Nada. My guess is that the people asking were not actual users, but rather people that “wanted to be” users. We had mistaken noise for signal.

**_Lesson learned:_**

“I would use your product if only you had X feature” is a dangerous signal to follow. Users do their best to anticipate what they want before they’ve seen it but, like entrepreneurs, they are often wrong.

Enterprise companies should validate demand by asking customers to put their money where their mouths are. Media and social networking companies should double down on analytics to find, observe, and build for actual user behavior.","We launched Sonar with Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare support.

"One of the most requested features was a “map like foursquare” for our check-ins. Instead, we appended a simple “@Sonar” to content that users shared from our app. Although we had designs for a map, we never got around to building one. We were too busy building the future of ambient social networking!

Mistake. People [didn’t like](http://www.quora.com/How-can-I-remove-the-sonarme-from-tweets-when-using-the-Sonar-app-on-my-iPhone) the bland “@Sonar” text string so they stopped sharing updates from Sonar. Their friends never engaged with our updates in the first place. Facebook noticed this and started hiding our posts. Instead of optimizing for actual user behavior, we spent countless whiteboarding sessions trying in vain to design an alternative.

"We received conflicting advice from lots of smart people about which is more important. We focused on engagement, which we improved by orders of magnitude. No one cared.

**_Lesson learned:_**

Growth is the only thing that matters if you are building a social network. Period. Engagement is great but you aren’t even going to get the meeting unless your top-line numbers reach a certain threshold (which is different for seed vs. series A vs. selling advertising).","We received conflicting advice from lots of smart people about which is more important.

"I realized the error of my customer acquisition strategy as I awkwardly made my way through a small Meetup I had just pitched. It was 11pm on a Tuesday, I was exhausted and still had real work to do once I got home. Yet there I was, in a shitty bar trying not to skewer anyone with my Sonar sign as I dodged person after person asking me to install THEIR app.

"When MTV, Kraft, Digitas, and the like reached out to us we weren’t sure what they wanted. It took us at least 10 meetings to realize that, rather than delivering us millions of their customers on a silver platter, they were keeping tabs on us so that they could get access to OUR audience if we ever took off!

**_Lesson Learned:_**

Be polite, but postpone brand and agency “intros” until you’ve built your own audience. If you build it, they will come (and pay).

Corollary: Investors know this. You sound stupid when you talk about your impending “big deal” with “XYZ brand” that’s going to drive massive customer acquisition and revenue.","When MTV, Kraft, Digitas, and the like reached out to us we weren’t sure what they wanted.

"In the winter of 2011, we signed a partnership w/ Wired magazine to demonstrate our technology by providing visitors of their Times Square popup store with personalized in-store product recommendations.

That “small side project” cost us 6 weeks of development and delivered no appreciable benefit other than getting to hang out with the cool people at Wired.

"In the run up to SXSW 2012 when the insider media had fabricated Highlight as heir to the throne and some of our more fair weather investors had written us off, my confidence was against the ropes. We reordered our roadmap to rush out comparable features but were now BEHIND. I put on my best brave face but inside my gut was rotting away. I still remember thinking on the flight to Austin “fck, we had it, and now we are going to lose it.”

Oops! Highlight never went anywhere but we definitely wasted a ton of energy and sleep “responding to the threat” when we should have been figuring out how to make our own business work.

**_Lesson Learned:_**

Be steady at the wheel. The only way one startup can kill another startup is by getting into the other’s head and leading them off a cliff.","In the run up to SXSW 2012 when the insider media had fabricated Highlight as heir to the throne and some of our more fair weather investors had written us off, my confidence was against the ropes.

"When the ambient social networking space iced over in the spring of 2012, Sonar’s controlling investors decided it was time to “flip the asset.” They connected us with a daily deals company looking for “Big Data” solutions. We stopped working on the app and devoted all of our resources to repacking our backend technology to solve BigCo’s problems. Instead of paring down expenses to extend our dwindling runway, we piled on hires and ramped up our infrastructure.

The daily deals space imploded but we spent nearly nine months, dozens of meetings, and several hundred thousand dollars “selling” Sonar into a company that nearly went bankrupt.

**_Lesson Learned:_**

Companies don’t get sold, they get bought. The best way to get bought is to build something of value. That’s hard to do when you are trying to sell.","When the ambient social networking space iced over in the spring of 2012, Sonar’s controlling investors decided it was time to “flip the asset.” They connected us with a daily deals company looking for “Big Data” solutions.

"We built Sonar out of an incubator that I helped launch in 2010. To be absolutely clear, the incubator was instrumental to getting Sonar off the ground and helped us considerably along the way. Unfortunately, there are a number of structural issues facing incubators and the operators they employ. I address some of these below.

The decoupling of responsibility from control created ambiguity and confusion, tension and frustration for all parties. From day to day decisions such as negotiating an employment contract to company defining ones such as when to sell the firm, alignment was a constant challenge. Occasionally, we were simply at odds.

Perhaps the most detrimental aspect of the incubator model was not its potential for hinderance but its facility as a crutch. As someone responsible for building and running a company that I ultimately didn’t control, it was far too easy to point a finger.","We built Sonar out of an incubator that I helped launch in 2010.

"In my opinion, the most tragic example came when our incubator sat on a financing that would have rebooted the company. After nearly a month at loggerheads, our would-be investors gave us 48 hours to “take it or leave it.” In hopes of saving the company, I made an ultimatum: we move forward together or I would have to walk away. No one budged, time elapsed, and our term sheet evaporated. I resigned as promised, blaming them for killing my baby.

**_Lesson Learned:_**

As John Burroughs said, “A man can fail many times, but he isn’t a failure until he begins to blame somebody else.” Avoid bad relationships like the plague but when you inevitably find yourself in a difficult partnership, don’t waste precious energy wailing against it. Make it work or move on quickly.","In my opinion, the most tragic example came when our incubator sat on a financing that would have rebooted the company.

"We lost our first would-be hire, a fantastic Google engineer. While we were debating his contract, he was taking a job elsewhere. Conversely, we hired another, much less proven, engineer on the spot. While he ultimately wasn’t a great cultural fit and we definitely waited too long to part ways, he was instrumental in getting V1 out the door.

**_Lesson Learned:_**

If you are an experienced entrepreneur with lots of options, by all means, hold out. For most first time entrepreneurs, holding out risks never getting off the ground.

In the beginning, established people probably won’t work with you. Prove yourself by finding diamonds in the rough, like yourself. With their help, you can level up your organization and convince the big fish to join.","We lost our first would-be hire, a fantastic Google engineer.

"We built an amazing team at Sonar. Everyone was extremely smart, passionate, dedicated, and hardworking. We celebrated milestones with tequila. We hung at the beach. Even when times were tough, everyone pushed as far as they possibly could, and then some. I have big love for all of my former colleagues and am confident they feel similarly.

That said, our culture was more of an emergent property than a deliberate choice. Sure, we had brainstorming sessions and posted goals prominently but most of our culture we absorbed from the people with whom we surrounded ourselves.

**_Lesson Learned:_**

Think of culture as a cofounder that is present when you are not. You are decisive, communicative, and respectful but it’s your culture that helps everyone know how to act when you are out of the room. Give that voice clarity and authority.","We built an amazing team at Sonar. Everyone was extremely smart, passionate, dedicated, and hardworking. We celebrated milestones with tequila.

Startups don’t die when they run out of money, they die when their founders let go. I ultimately stepped away from Sonar when I came to the conclusion that, despite all that we had invested, everyone stood a better chance starting anew. It’s difficult to accept, but sometimes you have to concede a battle to win the war.
