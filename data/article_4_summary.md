Our brothers and sisters in Ukraine are under attack from a vastly superior fighting force. [Russia is already fifteen miles from the capital.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/02/24/russia-ukraine-news-invasion-war-nato-putin-sanctions-latest/)

The world is so absurdly reliant on Russian energy exports.

Ukraine is so desperate that it plans to [hand out guns to citizens in the streets.](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1496785547594924032)

The Russian goal is to surround Kyiv and force the collapse of Zelenskyy's government. Russia probably won't start calling Ukraine “Russia’ by summer, he’ll re-install a proxy power.

Putin has never lost a war[.](https://www.newsweek.com/2022/03/11/putin-has-never-lost-war-here-how-hell-win-ukraine-1682878.html)

Putin says he feels like Ukraine is a threat to his gigantic nation. Ukraine is full of “[”](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-kiev-war-russia-putin-b2022057.html)

NAT hasn’t invaded Russia **once** since its creation, but Russia has *constantly stolen land from its neighbors. Can you blame them for joining a mutual defense alliance when there is an* numberactual *attack.*

NATations that feel threatened have a sovereign right to join NATO. This doesn't give Russia the right to defend themselves. But again, NATO isn't attacking Russia.

Ukrainian warlords have been fighting for control of the highly-strategic Crimea for more than [2,000 years](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1569684/Russia-Ukraine-Vladimir-Putin-separatist-states-evg)[**.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea)

Russia has no qualms about [starving millions of Ukrainians to death to feed its people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor)

Putin wants Russia to own [everything it has ever owned in history. He turns 70 this year, and he wants to restore the empire so he can be remembered in history like his hero.](https://snyder.substack.com/p/how-to-think-about-war-in-ukraine)

A Jewish TV comedian played a teacher who gets elected President after going on a rant about corruption.

Zelenskyy and his people will pay for it with their lives, so that one of the most corrupt leaders in history can amass even more power.

Ch!na [will likely step in to help Russia — or, at least, help the *wealthiest* in Russia.](https://survivingtomorrow.org/medium-has-never-ever-curated-a-single-story-ive-published-that-contains-the-c-word-2b6033475d58)

If Russia cuts off oil, gas, and fertilizer to the West, fuel and food prices could soar even higher than they already are.

*Investors are betting Ukraine falls and the Russian oil keeps flowing.*

Russia invaded Ukraine to solidify its grip on two eastern regions. We have learned nothing from history.

Pray and/or meditate about what actions we are to personally take with our families. Stop wasting money on stupid and selfish stuff and give it to aid organizations in Ukraine.

Only love can do the trick.
